      Israel’s brutal war on the people of Gaza, and the support this war has
      received from governments around the world, has once again shown that the
      modern Middle East is wracked by the violence of imperialism. A new
      generation of young people in the Western world have been shaken up by
      Israel’s actions, and in the process have come to reject many of the
      Zionist myths that for too long have hidden Israel’s crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many the oppression of the Palestinians seems similar to other
      examples of injustice that they care about, such as the treatment of
      African Americans, anti-migrant racism and the oppression of Indigenous
      peoples in Australia or the US. Israel is seen as another embodiment of
      white supremacy, colonialism and racism alongside Donald Trump, the
      police, Western corporations and the far right. This has given many the
      confidence to stridently reject the claims that criticising Israel is
      anti-Semitic and that the conflict is simply too complex to take a side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the young left-wing people grappling with these issues have
      adopted a framework for understanding them that is heavily influenced by
      the politics of settler colonial theory. This theory argues that many of
      the examples of racism and oppression seen in the world today are the
      products of colonialism, and often a particular form called settler
      colonialism. This colonialism is often seen as a product of “whiteness”
      and the inherent drive within Western culture to dominate other
      territories and peoples. Because of this, an anti-colonial struggle is
      needed that unites the Indigenous population and their potential allies
      against the settler population in a battle for decolonisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is seen as being a useful framework for understanding not only the
      plight of the Palestinians but also other cases of oppression and racism.
      So the oppression of Indigenous people within Australia is said to be due
      to an ongoing process of colonisation that benefits all of settler
      society. The same is true in the US, with the addition that racialised
      minorities such as African Americans or Hispanic and Latino Americans are
      seen as members of internal colonies being exploited by the rest of the
      settler population of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many, the politics of anti-colonialism has been a starting point for
      rejecting the racist lies of capitalist society and supporting the
      struggles of the oppressed. In this sense, it is a positive move away from
      the limitations of liberal multiculturalism and moderate centrism with its
      emphasis on gradually reforming capitalism into a supposedly
      “post-racial”, “colour-blind” society.

      However, there are also significant problems with settler colonial theory
      and the contemporary politics of anti-colonialism. Most importantly, it
      <a id="_Hlk165297808"></a>either discounts or heavily distorts the
      relationship between imperialism and racism, and abandons any serious
      understanding of class and capitalism more broadly. This has important
      implications for developing the kind of organisations and struggles we
      need to successfully confront racism and oppression in the Middle East and
      throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In previous issues of the <em>Marxist Left Review</em>, I’ve explored the
      problems that arise when applying settler colonial theory to understanding
      Indigenous oppression in Australia. In brief, I argued that settler
      colonial theory is inaccurate because it presents Indigenous oppression in
      contemporary Australia as being caused by an ongoing colonial process
      rather than capitalism. This leads settler colonial theorists to place the
      blame for anti-Indigenous racism on the entirety of “settler society”,
      including non-Indigenous workers. Settler colonial theorists argue that
      the mass of workers in Australia are essentially akin to the settler
      population in Israel. This ignores the history of non-Indigenous workers
      supporting the struggles of Indigenous people in Australia and absolves
      the Australian ruling class and capitalism of their role in oppressing
      Indigenous people.<sup

      When it comes to Israel and Palestine, however, settler colonial theory
      can seem much more useful. After all, Israel most definitely is a settler
      colonial state and it is involved in an ongoing process of colonisation in
      which it seeks to dispossess the Palestinian population of their remaining
      control over sections of Gaza and the West Bank. Also, while reasonable
      people can debate exactly why this is the case, it is clear that orienting
      towards the Israeli working class as the key ally for the Palestinians is
      a dead-end strategy. There is also a long tradition of radicals and
      socialists arguing that Israel is a settler colonial state to rebut those
      who want to defend Israel’s existence and its genocidal actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are <a id="_Hlk165297459"></a>important limitations to the
      settler colonial theory analysis even in the case of Israel and Palestine.
      Here we must distinguish between the
      <em>analysis that Israel is a settler colonial state</em>, a position
      shared by revolutionary Marxists, Arab nationalists, anarchists,
      Stalinists, anti-Zionist liberals and others, and the broader
      <em>political framework of settler colonial theory</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is absolutely correct to distinguish between the oppressors and
      the oppressed, this is only the beginning of any serious analysis of the
      oppression of the Palestinians. Unfortunately, the narrow framing of the
      question by settler colonial theorists as only being about settlers versus
      Indigenous people leaves essential questions unanswered. This article will
      hope to demonstrate that <a id="_Hlk165297781"></a>Marxism offers a much
      more sophisticated and deeper framework to understand Israel’s oppression
      of the Palestinians and its relationship to broader dynamics of capitalism
      in the Middle East and globally.
    </p>
    <h2>Colonialism, imperialism and capitalism in the Middle East</h2>
    <p>
      Control over the Middle East has long been an important project of various
      imperialist nations due to the region’s central role in both global trade
      routes and the production of raw materials, particularly oil. The
      geopolitical structure of the modern Middle East is largely the product of
      various partition plans and occupations by the British and French empires
      during the early twentieth century, who sought to mould the region to suit
      their interests. Following the decline of the European powers the United
      States took a leading role in defending and entrenching the interests of
      Western capitalism in the region, from forging alliances with the Gulf
      states and Egypt to providing Israel with military funding and diplomatic
      support, and invading countries that were seen as bucking Western control,
      such as Afghanistan and Iraq in the 2000s. This is the historical context
      for both the creation of the Israeli state, the role it has played in the
      region and the continued support it has obtained from capitalist
      governments around the world. So understanding, and opposing, colonialism
      and imperialism are of course important for grasping the history and
      present nature of the oppression of the Palestinians and the situation in
      the Middle East more generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is not the whole picture. While the Middle East has long
      been dominated by the interests of imperialist powers residing outside of
      the region, it would be wrong to present the situation as one of a
      homogeneous, undifferentiated “Middle East” dominated by foreign
      imperialism. As the Marxist writer Adam Hanieh has argued, “capitalist
      class formation in the Middle East has become increasingly tied to the
      ebbs and flows of accumulation at the global scale”, and this has led to
      the creation of a “domestic capitalist class internal to the Middle East
      that is to a great extent aligned with the interests of global
      (imperialist) capital”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref2"

              class="reference-body-link"

          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before Western imperialism established a foothold in the region, the
      Middle East was dominated by class societies with long-established
      structures of inequality and exploitation. Since then capitalism has
      developed throughout the region, creating powerful and wealthy ruling
      classes and states, and a mass of exploited workers. The modern Middle
      East is not simply dominated by imperialism, a system in which Middle
      Eastern ruling classes at any rate are complicit, it is also divided
      sharply by class. Challenging the class structure of the region and the
      capitalist system that underlies it must then be an essential part of any
      movement seeking to seriously combat imperialism in the Middle East.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is precisely on this point that settler colonial theorists fall short.
      Because they treat colonialism as a discrete factor that should be
      analysed primarily on its own terms, these theorists
      <a id="_Hlk165298045"></a>cannot accurately explain the roots of
      imperialism and they have little appreciation of the role that class and
      capitalism play in the region. They tend to apologise, either explicitly
      or implicitly, for the crimes of ruling classes among the oppressed group.
      In both these senses, settler colonial theory is a contemporary variation
      of the third world nationalism of earlier generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick Wolfe, the founder of settler colonial theory as an academic field
      of study, presents settler colonialism as a self-perpetuating political
      system in which settler societies are driven by a “logic of elimination”
      due to their desire for unrestricted control over land. Offhand references
      to capitalism aside, Wolfe spends little time looking at the material
      interests underlying this desire for land but rather focuses on its
      various ideological and cultural manifestations.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      As critics have increasingly noted, Wolfe also created a highly rigid and
      abstract model of colonialism, in which settler colonies, as distinct from
      franchise colonies, had no interest in the Indigenous population bar
      wiping them off the face of the earth, a crude picture that doesn’t fit
      with the concrete reality of settler colonial regimes across history.<sup

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      Lorenzo Veracini, another influential academic in the field, is even more
      explicit in seeing colonialism as an autonomous force to be analysed in
      isolation from the rest of society, theorising settler colonialism as a
      distinct “mode of domination”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref5"
              href="#_edn5"
              name="_ednref5"
              class="reference-body-link"
              >5</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to criticism that they ignore the material aspects of
      colonialism, settler colonial theorists have tried to relate their
      analysis to capitalism. They can only do so by significantly distorting
      what the capitalist system is and how it works, in order to make it fit
      into their inaccurate understanding of colonialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Veracini, drawing upon the economist David Harvey, argues that
      capitalism is defined by a constant and never-ending process of
      “accumulation by dispossession” or “perpetual primitive accumulation”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref6"
              href="#_edn6"
              name="_ednref6"
              class="reference-body-link"
              >6</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      By this Veracini means that what drives capitalism is the system’s need to
      steal land, resources and wealth by dispossession, force and theft. This
      then is supposedly the connection between settler colonialism and
      capitalism. Settler colonies like Israel are simply the vanguard of this
      process of dispossession, its most undiluted form. For Veracini settler
      colonialism even comes to “fundamentally define” the logic of modern
      capitalism. So the current workings of the financial institutions or the
      property market or the expansion of the fossil fuel industry are also said
      to be expressions of this “perpetual primitive accumulation” and bizarrely
      reveal that the whole world is a settler colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is very different from the traditional Marxist understanding of
      capitalism. Marx argued that what was at the core of the system was the
      exploitation of workers by bosses; it was this and only this that created
      the huge amounts of surplus wealth that the ruling class used to enrich
      themselves and create the whole modern industrial capitalist economy on a
      scale previously impossible. It is the exploitation of the working class,
      and the competition between bosses for control over the wealth this
      produces, that defines capitalism as a system. It is on this bedrock that
      the capitalist state system was constructed, to ensure the continued
      exploitation of labour power, to regulate the stability of capitalist
      society, and as the vehicle through which geopolitical competition between
      imperialist powers could play out. Dispossession, military conquest and
      outright theft of course occur, and have occurred under capitalism, but
      they happen within this broader context of the dynamics of capitalist
      society; they are not the driving feature of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settler colonial theory view of capitalism as driven by “accumulation
      by dispossession” or “perpetual primitive accumulation” echoes traditional
      liberal and reformist critiques of the system that see the problems of
      capitalism as due to its predatory nature rather than the production of
      surplus value through the economic exploitation of workers. As Jack
      Davies, a critic of settler colonial theory explains, for the settler
      colonial theorist:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [t]he problem with capitalism is, as it has always been, that it is
        predatory; and predation, on capitalism’s own ideology of justice and
        fairness, is immoral. This moralism evaporates the analytic distinctions
        that would specify the settler colony and acquits its theorist of
        historical study. Even the firm and gritty matter of land, settler
        colonialism’s “irreducible element”, is airily abstracted into
        phenomenological standpoint theories and metaphysical assertions about
        the “logic of elimination”.<sup
          ><sup
            ><span class="floating-ref-link"
              ><a

          ></sup
        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is unsurprising then that settler colonial theorists don’t appreciate
      the importance of understanding how <a id="_Hlk165298296"></a>class and
      capitalism underpin and shape imperialism, colonialism and racism. In
      particular, they fail to grasp how capitalism, due to its drive to gain
      profits out of the exploitation of workers, also creates a working class
      with the potential power to challenge its rule. This is something that
      would not occur if capitalism was simply stripping the Middle East of its
      resources and leaving nothing behind but a network of military bases. Of
      course, economic development in the Middle East has not been some linear
      progression that follows earlier European models. It <em>has </em>been
      marked by the interventions of powerful imperialist states who have sought
      to shape the economic structures of the region for their benefit, but also
      the emergence of domestic class forces, both rulers and ruled. As you
      would expect, given these complex and evolving factors, the nature of this
      intervention has changed over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Second World War economic development in the region was focused
      on supplying cotton, silk, wheat and olive oil to Europe, while the Middle
      East was seen as a market for some European goods such as textiles. During
      this period capitalist industry developed very slowly and the historian
      Anne Alexander argues that “the political and social institutions fostered
      by colonial-era capitalism were specifically designed to preclude” the
      development of domestic industry.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref8"
              href="#_edn8"
              name="_ednref8"
              class="reference-body-link"
              >8</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Even during this period though there were exceptions that would have
      ramifications for the later history of the region. Alexander points out
      that Iran and Turkey, which did not experience direct colonial rule, were
      able to begin the process of capitalist transformation much earlier, in
      the process becoming powerful states in the region. Meanwhile much of the
      Gulf also didn’t experience direct colonial control, because at first the
      economic value of the area was dismissed by the European powers. Once oil
      production entered the picture, the rulers of the Gulf were thrust into
      imperial relationships and capitalist development in a very different
      context from those countries that had suffered under decades of colonial
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1940s and ’50s saw explosive uprisings across the Middle East against
      colonial rule and economic inequality. Space opened up for greater
      economic development in the newly founded post-colonial states, albeit
      still shaped by the history of underdevelopment and hostility from rival
      imperialist powers. The second half of the twentieth century saw
      capitalist industry grow throughout the region and with it both industrial
      capitalist classes tied to various competing nation-states and working
      classes exploited by their rulers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contradictory dynamics of capitalist development in the Middle East is
      something ignored by settler colonial theorists. By seeing capitalism as
      essentially something external to the region parasitising it, rather than
      deeply embedded and constitutive of the social and political order of the
      region, is it little wonder then that the existence of Arab ruling classes
      and working classes is ignored by them?
    </p>
    <h2>The origins of Israel</h2>
    <p>
      Taking a closer look at how settler colonial theory analyses the nature of
      Israel and the oppression of the Palestinians – precisely the situation
      where it should be of most use – helps to clarify the pitfalls of their
      approach more concretely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origins of the Israeli state are commonly portrayed by settler
      colonial theorists as lying in the Jewish settlers making a pact with the
      West to serve its interests in the region and in the process transforming
      themselves into a “white” population. As academic Johannes Becke writes,
      “While American Jews became white by suburbanisation, Israeli Jews did so
      by colonization”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref9"

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a very reductive understanding of the origins of Israel on a
      number of levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, it obscures the fact that imperialist nations came to
      support the Zionist state because it was perceived to be in the interests
      of their ruling classes and states to do so. It wasn’t in the interests of
      the undifferentiated mass of people living in the Western countries, the
      vast majority of whom had no say in the matter anyway. Class divisions run
      through the so-called “West”.

      Secondly, settler colonial theorists see the similarities between the
      colonial ideologies of the Zionists and the West as key to explaining why
      Western governments supported the creation of Israel. However, the
      relationship between Western governments and the Zionist movement was
      complicated, tension-filled and evolved over time, undermining the idea
      that common cultural affinities between the two drove the relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British government, the key Western player in the region in the
      lead-up to 1948, was primarily concerned with entrenching its control over
      Mandate Palestine, not, at least initially, in supporting the narrow goals
      of the Zionist movement. There was considerable debate within the London
      colonial elite about the positives and negatives of the Zionist project.
      These debates were underpinned by discussions about what course would best
      serve the material interests of British imperialism first and foremost.
      While the British were happy to suppress the rights of the Palestinians,
      they were hesitant for a long time about unconditionally backing the
      creation of a Jewish state. They preferred to lord over the region
      themselves and play the Jewish and Arab populations off against each
      other, even while granting more concessions and privileges to the Jewish
      settlers. As the Zionist movement emerged as a powerful force, the British
      government came to endorse this project as seemingly the best way to
      stabilise Western influence over the Zionists and the region in the
      upheavals of the postwar world.

    <p>
      The United States, which would emerge in the postwar world as the major
      Western imperialist power, was also ambivalent about Israel for some time.
      It endorsed the establishment of Israel in 1948 but then opposed the
      failed 1956 invasion of Egypt by Israel, Britain and France. There was a
      strong “Arabist” wing of the American state department that worried that
      if the US backed Israel it would send Arab states into the arms of the
      Soviet Union. It was only after Israel had proven its military credentials
      in the 1967 war that American state officials swung around to build the
      tight alliance with Israel they have today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it is also important to note that it was not only the traditional
      imperialist countries of the West that endorsed the establishment of
      Israel. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to recognise
      Israel, and both the USSR and its satellite states in Eastern Europe
      supported the UN partition plan in 1947. Until the 1950s the Soviet Union
      either supported Israel or took a neutral position on conflicts between it
      and the Arab states. This further complicates the idea that Israel was
      simply created by the West. It was also a factor in British support for
      Israel – they were worried that otherwise it could fall into the Soviet
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Settler colonial theorists also tend to downplay the existence of class
      dynamics and capitalist relations within the Zionist movement and Israeli
      society. Patrick Wolfe, drawing upon another settler colonial theorist,
      Gershon Shafir, argues that the accumulation of capital was absent from
      Zionist settler society. Instead, the Zionist economy was based on
      “non-profit-seeking capital” organised in the collective organisations
      valorised by the “socialist” wing of the Zionist movement. In Wolfe’s
      eyes, the settler community was essentially a classless one, outside of
      capitalism.<sup

    <p>
      The ideological character of the Zionist movement, its focus on creating a
      separate Jewish state as supposedly the only way to escape European
      anti-Semitism, is of course essential to understanding why the movement
      decided to colonise Palestine. The Zionist colonisation of Palestine then
      wasn’t driven crudely by profit rates; but that doesn’t mean issues of
      class and capitalism were irrelevant to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start with, contra Wolfe, by 1948, 60 percent of the Israeli economy
      was owned by private capitalists. As well, the capital invested into
      “collective” Zionist organisations such as the Histadrut was created via
      exploitation both among the Jewish diaspora and in the decades before and
      after the creation of Israel. As such, there were clear class divisions
      among the Jewish settlers, leading to strikes against Jewish bosses. More
      significantly Wolfe sidesteps the issue of why other capitalist nations
      would support the creation of the Zionist state and the disruption of an
      entire region. From a Marxist point of view, it can only be because of the
      material interests of those capitalist states in promoting the creation of
      a pro-imperialist enclave in the region.<sup

      The argument that Jewish settlers transformed themselves into a “white”
      population and that Israel is an example of white supremacy is also
      dubious. There are indeed white nationalists like Richard Spencer who
      champion Israel. There are also certain similarities between how Zionism
      racialises the Arab world and racism in Western countries. And there is
      clearly discrimination against Jews from non-white backgrounds in Israel,
      such as those who arrived from the Middle East, North Africa or Ethiopia.
      However, as the Jewish anti-Zionist historian Tony Greenstein argues:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [T]he major division within Israeli society is not between black and
        white, but between Jewish and non-Jewish, and in particular between
        Israeli Jewish and Palestinian… The Law of Return allows Jews of any
        colour to emigrate to Israel anytime they want. That is not a right
        which non-Jews – black or white – possess. Only Jews can be nationals in
        Israel and some 93 percent of Israeli land is Jewish national land from
        which non-Jews are legally barred… Of course, the best land in Israel is
        reserved for the Ashkenazim. So yes, Zionism is certainly tainted by
        white supremacy, but this is a secondary, not primary, feature.<sup

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The idea that Jewish settlers – including the many Black and Brown ones –
      became “white” springs from the illogical underpinnings of identity
      politics which is deeply embedded within settler colonial theory. It flows
      from the idea that imperialism, racism and colonialism are products of
      “whiteness” and Western culture, rather than something pursued by
      capitalist states and nationalist movements regardless of their race or
      ethnicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are Hindu nationalists in Modi’s India “white” because they organise
      violent attacks on Muslims and other minorities? Granted, these divisions
      have historic roots in the imperialist strategies of the old British Raj,
      but they continue today because of the political dynamics of contemporary
      Hindu nationalism. The reality is that violent oppression is something
      that all sorts of capitalist states, political parties and movements can
      participate in. As capitalist development has spread across the world,
      including into the Global South, more and more non-Western countries have
      become violent and oppressive capitalist states. To explain this reality
      by claiming that ruling figures in these societies have become “white”
      would mean describing large parts of Asia, the Middle East, Latin America
      and Africa as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the current settler colonial projects in the world today are being
      carried out by “non-white” countries. China’s ongoing push to replace
      Uyghurs with Han Chinese settlers in Xinjiang, India’s colonisation of
      Kashmir and the genocide of the Rohingya by the military of Myanmar are
      just some of the most prominent examples. Most theorists of settler
      colonialism show little interest in this, presumably because it goes
      against the thesis that settler colonialism is a product of Western
      culture, and it cuts against the softness on non-Western governments
      notable in settler colonial theory circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the settler colonial theory framework downplays how the class
      divisions within the Palestinian population and the broader Arab world
      facilitated the rise of the Zionist state. Absentee Palestinian landlords
      sold large tracts of land to the Zionist organisations, helping them gain
      a substantial foothold in the region. When Palestinian peasants and
      workers erupted into protest against Zionist attacks, some sections of the
      Arab elite helped the British crush these movements. King Abdullah I of
      Jordan, for instance, forged an alliance with the Zionists in the 1930s
      and received money from the Jewish Agency, a branch of the World Zionist
      Organization. When the revolt of 1936 began he helped Zionist and British
      forces isolate and eventually defeat the rebellion. At one point he even
      tried to encourage Zionist settlement in Jordan, a move blocked by the
      British government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palestinian elites, such as the al-Husayni family, held back the struggles
      of the Palestinians, instead placing their hopes in negotiations with the
      British government. This led to a series of tragic defeats for the
      Palestinians that paved the way for the victory of the Zionist forces in
      1948. After the <em>Nakba</em>, Arab ruling classes treated the mass of
      poor Palestinian refugees disgracefully, shunting them away into refugee
      camps. It was a different story for the elite of Palestinian society, who
      quickly carved out a position for themselves within the Arab states as
      successful business owners and professionals.<sup

      This history makes it clear that we can’t have a simple picture of
      Indigenous people united against settler populations and imperialism. Like
      so many groups of people the category of Indigenous is divided by class,
      shaped by capitalism.
    </p>
    <h2>A common community of settler colonies?</h2>
    <p>
      Another example of the pitfalls of the settler colonial framework is the
      idea that the reason Western countries like Australia, the United States,
      Canada and New Zealand support Israel is because of their common heritage
      as settler colonial states. As Jewish Voice for Peace Deputy Director
      Cecilie Surasky puts it: “The ‘special relationship’ between Israel and
      the United States is rooted in our common national narratives and founding
      mythology”.<sup
        ><sup

    <p>
      But this can’t explain why governments that have suffered from colonialism
      such as Modi’s administration in India or the Kenyan government are such
      strong supporters of Israel. Conversely, it cannot explain why countries
      like Indonesia that are currently engaged in colonisation are capable of
      opposing Israel’s actions, even if only at the rhetorical level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the cases of the United States and Australia, the establishment’s
      support for Israel has little to do with some shared history of settler
      colonialism. They support Israel because it is in the interest of their
      ruling classes to do so. They want to enforce their dominance over the
      global capitalist system by strengthening their hold over one of the key
      pillars of Western imperialism in the Middle East. If for some reason it
      was no longer in their imperialist interests to support Israel then the
      ruling classes of the West wouldn’t do so, no matter what shared history
      they might have. This explains why neither the US or Australia are
      particularly supportive of Chinese colonisation of Tibet and Xinjiang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constant historical analogies and abstract categories of settler
      colonial theorists end up distorting how the world really works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that Western nations support Israel because of their common
      colonial history also repeatedly spills over into cultural explanations
      for imperialist backing of Israel rather than material ones. Surasky from
      Jewish Voice for Peace argues that:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If the root of this special relationship is not as much AIPAC [American
        Israel Public Affairs Committee] and money, as much as it is our
        national narrative and the feelings it engenders – and an unquestioning
        belief that Israel has an infinite right to expand onto other people’s
        land, then it is narrative that holds unconditional support in place,
        and our resistance must also be at the level of narrative.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “All of us in this movement”, Surasky concludes, “have to decolonize our
      minds”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a

        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that Western support for Israel isn’t due to the influence of
      AIPAC. But nor is it simply rooted in “our national narrative and the
      feelings it engenders”, as I’ve already made clear. Narratives can change,
      and feelings are fickle, but America’s bipartisan support for Israel is
      grounded in material interests that are yet to be shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flipside of the argument that Western support for Israel is based on
      the common heritage of settler colonies also often goes along with the
      idea that there is also a group of nations that are leading an
      anti-colonial struggle against Israel, such as South Africa, Ireland, or
      one or another of the Arab states, particularly those outside the Western
      camp such as Iran or Syria. Some influenced by a more hardened Stalinist
      approach champion China or Russia as the saviours of the Palestinians.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is based upon an extremely shallow and idealised picture of these
      nations, as well as a misunderstanding of the nature of modern
      imperialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt Kennard, a left-wing investigative journalist and founder of
      Declassified UK, has argued that not only is “solidarity with
      Palestinians…woven into the fabric” of the Irish nationalist party Sinn
      Féin but that “[e]very major political party in the Republic of Ireland
      now supports Palestinian liberation”.<sup

      The reality is quite different. While support for Palestine is quite high
      among the population, socialists in Ireland have repeatedly criticised the
      government of the Republic of Ireland, composed of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael
      and the Green Party, of “paddy-washing genocide”.<sup

      As they point out, the Irish government has refused to expel the Israeli
      ambassador and didn’t even bring itself to openly support South Africa’s
      case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

      Sinn Féin is rhetorically more pro-Palestine, and there is considerable
      support for the issue among the party’s membership. However, the
      pro-capitalist core of this party does not have any genuine commitment to
      fighting against imperialism in the Middle East or elsewhere. When Joe
      Biden visited Ireland in 2023 Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald ruled out
      talking to him about Palestine, and instead focused on “Ireland-specific
      issues”. In October 2023, after Israel’s attack on Gaza had been going on
      for three weeks, Sinn Féin hailed the arrival of US Special Envoy to
      Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III. As the Irish socialist Somhairle Mag
      Uidhir explained:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        They wined and dined with him at Stormont and with city councillors in
        Belfast City Hall, got in multiple photo ops across the North, and
        defiantly trumpeted his presence. While thousands remained trapped under
        genocide’s rubble, they didn’t utter a peep about the US backing of the
        Israeli murder machine, much less challenge it. Joe Biden was never
        named publicly, his main man in the North, Joe Kennedy, given a hero’s
        welcome when he should have been shunned as a Zionist villain.<sup

    <p>
      The government of South Africa also attracted a lot of support from
      pro-Palestine activists when it brought Israel before the IJC on the
      charge of genocide. However, we should be clear that South Africa is not
      leading an alliance of anti-colonial states in a struggle against
      imperialism. It is itself a regional capitalist power that seeks to
      project its influence across Africa while shooting down striking workers
      and building strong economic ties with the West. The South African ruling
      class may see in this crisis an opportunity to create some space for
      itself on the global stage. But it does so not to challenge global
      inequalities but to enrich and empower itself. Domestically, Ramaphosa’s
      government remains committed to entrenching privatisation, anti-poor and
      anti-worker policies, and a reactionary social agenda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even on the question of Israel, there is much hypocrisy in the South
      African government’s positioning. In 2021 trade between South Africa and
      Israel was valued at $285 million, a third of all trade between
      Sub-Saharan Africa and Israel. In 2022 53 percent of South African coal
      exports went to Israel, as did a quarter of its diamonds. Despite
      significant public pressure South African companies have refused to cut
      economic ties to Israel since the outbreak of the current war in October
      last year, and the president of South Africa defied a parliamentary vote
      to expel the Israeli ambassador.<sup

    <h2>Class divisions among the Palestinians</h2>
    <p>
      Settler colonial theory also significantly downplays, and often totally
      ignores, the class dynamics within the Palestinian population. As noted
      earlier, this was a feature of Palestinian society from the very
      beginning. Since the <em>Nakba</em> the class divisions among Palestinians
      have continued to be an important issue. The hundreds of thousands of
      Palestinians expelled from Palestine were integrated into the class
      structures within the surrounding Arab states which if anything
      exaggerated the already-existing class differences among Palestinians.<sup

      Wealthier Palestinians were more insulated from the worst effects of the
      expulsion. Many Palestinian merchants, bankers and entrepreneurs already
      had well-established links with capitalists and markets in Arab countries,
      and transferred what movable assets they could. They then quickly merged
      into the broader Arab ruling classes, their sons and daughters marrying
      the children of the Jordanian, Lebanese and Saudi elites. By the 1960s
      there were hundreds of Palestinian millionaires throughout the Gulf
      states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Middle-class Palestinians suffered more but most were able to find
      employment as professionals or at least skilled workers. Many Arab regimes
      seeking to modernise became reliant upon the more educated Palestinian
      middle classes to serve as government administrators, educators and the
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighty percent of the Palestinian refugee population, however, were former
      peasants and unskilled workers who were viewed as unwelcome and
      potentially rebellious visitors by the Arab governments. Despite
      incredible difficulties, this population became more and more integrated
      into the working class of the Arab world, often forming a particularly
      radical wing of the workers’ movement. So Palestinian workers played a key
      role in unionising the oil, construction and transport industries in
      Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. In Jordan, the Palestinian population
      became a large section of the working class and helped form left-wing
      unions and organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is these class divisions that lay behind many of the political debates
      within the Palestinian national movement. The disastrous concept that the
      PLO should look primarily to the Arab states for support didn’t come out
      of nowhere, but reflected the fact that the upper sections of the
      Palestinian population were deeply connected materially to the Arab
      regimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick Wolfe has defended the absence of any discussion about the class
      divisions within nationally oppressed groups such as the Palestinians by
      stating that: “I have regularly been accused of binarism – though not once
      by a Native”.<sup

        populations. Some are keen to preserve the occupation/colonialism… For
        some, “elimination” means enrichment through settler-capitalist
        domination and its stabilization of neo-colonial domination in the West
        Bank and the tendrils of finance linking that to Gulf capitalist class
        formation, while for some, displacement has meant immiseration in the

      Some anti-colonial theorists can acknowledge divisions within national
      movements but they see elite layers within nationally oppressed
      populations as simply sellouts putting their own narrow interests above
      that of the national movement as a whole, rather than a class pursuing its
      own class interests. They also often underestimate the problem of
      middle-class layers within these movements having different class
      interests from the mass of workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This echoes the political framework of Arab nationalists and the Stalinist
      left who draw a distinction between sections of the Arab elite, or
      particular leaders or governments, who have become pawns of imperialism,
      and the “patriotic bourgeoisie” and supposedly anti-imperialist states.
      However, as Adam Hanieh argues, “it makes little sense to identify a
      ‘national’ bourgeoisie whose interests are somehow counterposed to those
      of large international or regional capital”; and
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        it is a fantasy to hold out the possibility of convincing a “patriotic

      The role that the Palestinian Authority has played in working with the
      Israeli state to suppress any genuine resistance to Israeli rule is often
      seen as an example of a small section of elites selling out the nation’s
      cause. Hanieh explains though how the actions of the Palestinian Authority
      are only explicable from an analysis of the class structure of Palestinian
      society. Since Israel occupied it in 1967 the economy of the West Bank has
      transformed from a mainly rural one dominated by structures of traditional
      village life into “an incorporated, dependent, and subordinated appendage
      of Israeli capitalism”. This shift saw the mass of the Palestinian
      population dispossessed of what little land they still controlled and
      proletarianised while at the same time there developed “a tiny layer of
      Palestinian capital that articulates Israeli rule and whose accumulation
      is dependent on that meditating position”.<sup

      The Palestinian writer Toufic Haddad similarly writes about how the basis
      for the Palestinian Authority was constructed through an “interpermeation
      of interests” between Palestinian diaspora capitalists in the Arab states
      and domestic Palestinian capitalists in the West Bank, with the aim to
      “consolidate a strata of political and economic elites in the West Bank
      tied to the political economy of neoliberal state building”; meanwhile of
      course “the majority of Palestinian society remained disenfranchised
      politically and economically”.<sup

      The focus that settler colonial theorists have on how settler colonies
      like Israel are motivated by a desire to eliminate Indigenous populations
      rather than exploit them also reinforces this tendency to ignore questions
      of class among the Palestinian population. As a number of scholars
      critical of settler colonial theory argue:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [T]he prevailing scholarly emphasis on the elimination of the native, at
        the expense of labor exploitation, not only is an analytical shortcoming
        but also obscures the link between the political, economic, and military
        violence of the occupation and the extraction of Palestinian labor-power
        by different means.<sup

      It is true that since 1993 in particular Israel has sought to largely
      exclude the Palestinian population from as much of the Israeli workforce
      as possible, in order to marginalise their potential economic and
      political power. Historically though this was not always the case, and the
      integration of Palestinians into the Israeli economy was an important
      factor behind the First Intifada. The more important problem here however
      is that simply stating that Israel has no need for Palestinian workers and
      therefore issues of class and exploitation are irrelevant in the case of
      settler colonialism ignores how these issues are very relevant for the
      Palestinians who live and work in the broader region. Finally, the logic
      of elimination tells us nothing about who and how we can resist the
      undeniable genocide that Israel is carrying out. Only a Marxist assessment
      of the issues brings to the fore the exploited classes across the Middle
      East as a whole which are key to liberating Palestine.
    </p>
    <h2>Anti-colonial struggle?</h2>
    <p>
      Another feature of settler colonial theory is the inaccurate way it
      presents “anti-colonial” or “anti-imperialist” struggle. The academic
      founders of settler colonial theory were in fact deeply ambiguous about
      the possibility of struggle against settler colonialism, or at least
      anything anyone left-wing would recognise as struggle. So Patrick Wolfe
      argues:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In the settler colonial economy, it is not the colonist but the native
        who is superfluous. This means that the sanctions practically available
        to the native are ideological ones. In settler colonial formations, in
        order words, ideology has a higher systemic weighting – it looms larger,
        as it were – than in other colonial formations.<sup
          ><sup
            ><span class="floating-ref-link"
              ><a
                id="_ednref27"

        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Thus it is only on the ideological terrain that Palestinians can hope to
      perhaps disrupt settler colonialism, presumably by exploiting the
      contradiction between public endorsements of human rights, equality, etc.
      with the reality of oppression. As one critic explains, “Wolfe’s reversion
      to ideology as the level of struggle in the settler colony is a desperate
      move” that “would appear to suggest that what we might call ‘real
      conditions’ in the settler colony do not admit the possibility of other
      forms of struggle for the native”.<sup

      More seriously minded settler colonial theorists are more likely to look
      towards military actions such as those carried out by Hamas in October
      2023, Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, or at best armed struggle like
      that engaged in by the old Palestine Liberation Organization. While armed
      action against imperialist forces and the violent ruling classes of the
      region can hardly be ruled out by any movement seeking to transform the
      Middle East, to elevate this particular form of action is to drastically
      distort what it will take to liberate Palestine and indeed the broader
      region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperialism and capitalism in the region is underpinned by multiple
      powerful ruling classes, both foreign and domestic, with substantial
      financial and military resources and a proven track record of unleashing
      violence against any serious signs of opposition. No armed force not
      connected to one or another of these ruling classes has the capacity to
      defeat such an extensive system of power and control. And those that are
      well funded and armed, such as the Saudi and Emirati militaries, do not
      wish to see imperialism defeated because they are part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation, Marxists look towards the potential power of a mass
      working-class movement as the only solution. The classic features of such
      a movement through history – grassroots workplace activism and
      organisation, general strikes, and eventually mass insurrections in major
      urban centres – places in it a unique position to challenge the ruling
      classes and states of the Middle East. And we have seen examples of
      exactly this kind of struggle in the region before. During the 1940s and
      ’50s there was a wave of mass working-class revolt in many Middle Eastern
      countries.

      In Egypt an independent workers’ movement arose that challenged not just
      colonial rule but capitalist exploitation, culminating in a massive strike
      movement erupting in February 1946. The anti-Zionist Jewish socialist
      writer Tony Cliff captured some of the key features of this huge strike:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In Alexandria the students turned towards the workers and arranged a
        large demonstration together with them. A few days later – on the 21st.
        February, “Evacuation Day” – about 100,000 workers and students made a
        strike and demonstration in Cairo. The spirit of the demonstrators was
        clearly revealed in the fact that none of the traditional parties had
        any sway over them… The solidarity of Moslems, Christians and Jews was
        an oft-repeated slogans [sic] throughout the demonstrations. Sudanese
        students studying in Egypt who called for a common struggle against
        British imperialism were carried shoulder high.<sup

    <p>
      Cliff explains that the demonstrations and strikes were organised by a
      workers’ and students’ committee which was “democratically elected” and
      truly “representative of the masses”, whose “members were chosen in
      democratic elections from each faculty and trade union” and in “every
      quarter of Cario special local quarter committees were also elected” with
      worker activists in the “big foreign companies” having a “decisive
      influence on the direction of the movement”. In Alexandria, it was
      anti-Stalinist activists who had a majority on the city-wide workers’ and
      students’ committee.<sup

      Such scenes were repeated in Iraq, which was shaken by huge protests and
      general strikes that fused together anti-colonial and class demands. In
      1948 a mass urban rebellion erupted against the killing of student
      protesters, with striking oil workers in Kirkuk playing a key role in
      radicalising the movement. The rebellion was suppressed but followed by a
      new uprising in 1952. Even after a group of nationalist military officers
      took power in 1958, strikes continued and Communists could reportedly
      bring over 1 million people onto the streets in demonstrations.<sup

      More recently the revival of strike action by key sections of workers was

    <h2>The class basis of anti-colonial politics</h2>
    <p>
      The <a id="_Hlk165300338"></a>politics of settler colonial theory are not
      simply ill-thought-out ideas. If taken seriously as a guide to action they
      would be disastrous for building a movement that can actually challenge
      imperialism and capitalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In South Africa, the theory that Africans suffered from “internal
      colonisation” was developed by primarily white intellectuals around the
      South African Communist Party. They used the theory to justify the
      pro-capitalist strategy of the African National Congress, which sought to
      narrow the radicalism of African workers around a program of simply
      replacing the racist apartheid regime with a new capitalist government
      controlled by a Black elite. In the United States, Black Power activist
      Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture) and political scientist Charles V Hamilton
      used the theory that African Americans were a colony within the US to
      argue for building up a Black political power bloc. This ultimately
      primarily benefited the layer of Black mayors, congressmen and police
      chiefs who were elected to supposedly decolonise urban spaces. In
      Australia anti-colonial rhetoric is just as often used to argue for more
      Indigenous-owned businesses, NGOs and government bureaucracies as it is to
      argue for any genuine struggle against racism, let alone capitalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the twentieth century, we saw anti-colonial movements win
      across Africa, Asia and the Middle East. While socialists celebrated the
      end of direct colonial rule, we need to be clear that in none of these
      cases did anti-colonial revolutions lead to societies based on equality
      and justice. Instead new capitalist states were created, with continued
      exploitation and oppression the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ironically the classless politics of anti-colonialism actually has a class
      basis. It represents the interests of all those social layers –
      middle-class intellectuals, state bureaucrats and aspiring politicians
      from oppressed backgrounds – who might oppose racism, or war or a
      particular national oppression but don’t want the capitalist system to
      end. Instead, they want a new nation-state or business or bureaucracy in
      which they or someone from their background are in control.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are of course those on the left who adopt the politics of settler
      colonial theory but consider themselves to be fighting for something more
      radical than the examples raised above. But the problem is that the logic
      of anti-colonial politics inevitably leads towards pro-capitalist
      so-called solutions to the issues of racism and imperialism. Its very
      framing reinforces the idea that the key division in the world is
      different national groups rather than classes, and that the problems of
      the world are due to things external or secondary to capitalism, rather
      than the fundamental nature of the system itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sai Englert, a socialist writer, argues that one of the benefits of
      settler colonial theory is that it can provide a framework for a struggle
      for liberation that can foster “unity across different sections of the
      Palestinian people”. But unity with whom and on what political basis?
      Englert’s <em>Settler Colonialism: An Introduction </em>discusses many
      examples of movements against national oppression, including in Palestine,
      but at no point even acknowledges, let alone discusses, the different
      class forces within them, opting for uncritical veneration instead.<sup

      Many of the people protesting for Palestine today are doing so at least in
      part because of these anti-colonial ideas, which make sense as a starting
      point given the weakness of class struggle and the left. But if we are to
      begin to build the kinds of organisations we need to actually defeat
      capitalism and imperialism then as many people as possible need to go
      beyond the limits of these politics.

    <p>
      Throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries we’ve had all sorts of
      very radical, even revolutionary-sounding anti-racist and anti-imperialist
      theories: racial-capitalism, revolutionary black nationalism, dependency
      theory, third-worldism, Guevarism and so forth. But when put into practice
      they all ended in disaster. The uncritical championing of Indigenous
      nationalist movements by settler colonial theorists echoes the problems of
      third worldism that influenced much of the radical left in the second half
      of the twentieth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faced with another century of brutal wars and vicious oppression we need
      clear Marxist politics that emphasises the necessity of confronting the
      underlying structures of capitalism through the immense potential power of
      the working class.
