  From Marx to Lenin: Debates that forged the socialist approach to war
  <p>
    In an era of intensifying imperialist tensions between the US and China, an
    accelerating arms build-up by all the major powers and the growing threat of
    all-out war, in part foreshadowed by the current brutal war in Ukraine, it
    is worth looking back at the debates among socialists in the lead-up to and
    during the First World War. It was out of those at times furious debates,
    literally in the heat of battle, that the Marxist approach to imperialism
    and the struggle against war was forged. The economic and political
    realities today are, of course, not entirely the same. The imperialist
    pecking order has changed substantially, most notably in recent decades with
    the rise of China. The destructive capacities of the competing militaries
    have been qualitatively enhanced with the development of nuclear weapons
    which threaten the very existence of the planet. Nonetheless the vital
    insights developed by Lenin, Luxemburg, Trotsky, Bukharin and other
    revolutionaries of that earlier period of rising imperialist contention and
    eventual world war still provide sound foundations upon which socialists can
    build.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 4th of August 1914 was a decisive turning point for the socialist
    movement. The collapse of the great majority of parties of the Second
    Socialist International into pro-war chauvinism and support for their own
    ruling classes laid the basis for a fundamental divide in the socialist
    movement between reformists and revolutionaries, leading to the eventual
    founding in March 1919 of the Third Communist International – the Comintern.
  </p>
  <p>
    The capitulation of these supposed Marxist parties, above all the German
    Social Democratic Party (SPD), the leading party of the Second
    International, was the product of a long-term degeneration and accommodation
    to the capitalist system by the leadership of the parties and their
    associated trade unions. It was not simply a question of a mistaken position
    on war policy or militarism but reflected a broader integration into the
    capitalist system, and an increasing identification with their own nation
    state. This dynamic was most pronounced among the trade union leaders and a
    cohort of MPs and party functionaries. Well before 4 August these leaders
    had abandoned the interests of their working-class followers and crossed
    over to the side of the bourgeoisie. The debates in the socialist parties
    about war, colonial policy, militarism and imperialism which occurred in
    these years were but one reflection of that broader capitulation – though a
    most decisive one.
  </p>
  <h2>Marx and Engels on war</h2>
  <p>
    The original Marxist approach to war developed by Marx and Engels occurred
    in a period prior to the rise of modern capitalist imperialism. Marx and
    Engels saw war as an abomination that was part of the very essence of
    capitalism and previous class societies. It was only with the overthrow of
    capitalism and the development of a socialist world order that war could be
    eliminated. The First International, formed in 1864, in which Marx and
    Engels played a leading role, denounced standing armies as an incitement to
    militarism and championed instead the concept of the popular militia with
    officers democratically elected. They believed that a popular militia would
    be less amenable to being used by governments to crush strikes and
    working-class revolts.

  <p>
    Marx and Engels supported the victory of the rising capitalist powers in
    their wars against semi-feudal reaction, drawing a parallel with the wars of
    revolutionary France against the old feudal powers, backed by England, which
    sought to crush the great revolution. In particular they supported wars
    against tsarist Russia which they saw as the backbone of reaction in Europe.
    At the time of the 1848 revolutionary wave that swept Europe they called on
    the forces of democracy to wage a revolutionary war against tsarism. They
    believed that the defeat of tsarism would speed up the coming proletarian
    revolution. Over subsequent years they continued to call on England and the
    other powers to wage war on tsarism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Marx and Engels also supported wars of national reunification in Italy and
    Germany. They supported the North against the slave-holding South in the US
    Civil War and the armed national rebellions in Ireland and Poland. They
    believed these were progressive wars that would hasten the development of
    capitalism and put workers in a better position to fight for freedom.
  </p>
  <p>
    In wars between capitalist powers Marx and Engels supported the principle of
    national defence. In the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian war that culminated in the
    1871 Paris Commune, Marx and Engels took a concrete tactical approach based
    on their assessment of whose victory best served the interests of the
    revolutionary cause. At the outbreak of the fighting they supported a
    defensive war by Prussia, which they hoped would precipitate the downfall of
    the reactionary Bonapartist French regime. After the fall of Bonaparte they
    opposed the Prussian invasion of France and went on to support the defence
    of Paris by the popular forces of the National Guard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Marx and Engels’ general attitude to war was appropriate until roughly the
    1880s, when the rapid development of imperialist competition demanded a new
    approach. It is debatable exactly when the modern imperialist system was
    consolidated, but it definitely had been by the beginning of the twentieth
    century. In a world increasingly carved up by the imperialist powers, the
    principle of national defence had been made redundant for the likes of
    Britain, France, the US and Germany. Indeed talk of national defence was now
    a reactionary concept in any war between the imperialist powers. By the
    early 1890s Engels sensed an important change had occurred and warned of the
    threat of a reactionary Europe-wide war which could devastate the continent
    and derail the development of the working-class movement. However there was
    a considerable delay before socialists developed an approach to war
    appropriate for the modern imperialist epoch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even Lenin, later vital to the development of a Marxist theory of
    imperialism, long held to elements of the old approach. Seeing tsarist
    Russia as the main enemy, in 1904 Lenin supported the defeat of Russia by
    Japanese imperialism, which he argued was a progressive force. In January
    1905 he

    at the fall of the Russian garrison at Port Arthur, regarding “progressive”,
    “advanced” Asia as having dealt an irreparable blow to old, “reactionary”,
    “backward” Europe.<sup

    This approach of advocating the defeat of reactionary tsarism, even if by
    other imperialist forces, still coloured Lenin’s standpoint at the outbreak
    of World War I.
  </p>
  <h2>The road to capitulation</h2>
  <p>
    In the early 1900s a number of Marxist theorists, including Rudolph

    The resolution against war adopted at the 1907 Stuttgart conference of the
    Socialist International and reaffirmed in 1910 at Copenhagen and again in
    1912 at Basel, implicitly (but only implicitly) broke with the old Marx and
    Engels approach. It proclaimed that the socialist parties should stridently
    oppose the outbreak of war:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Should war break out none the less, it is their duty to intervene in
      favour of its speedy termination and to do all in their power to utilise
      the economic and political crisis caused by the war to rouse the peoples
      and thereby to hasten the abolition of capitalist domination.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref3"

              class="reference-body-link"
              >3</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    A worthy declaration is one thing; more important, however, is what is done
    in practice. The Second International was not a centralised body but a
    federation of national parties that held Congresses roughly every three
    years. The individual national parties were not mandated to carry out the
    decisions of those Congresses. An International Socialist Bureau was
    established as an executive of the International in 1900 but its decisions
    were also only recommendations. The International developed no clear
    guidelines for collective action to fight militarism and no common program
    when war erupted. Thus for example at the special Basel Congress of the
    International in November 1912, called in response to the outbreak of the
    Balkan Wars, there was plenty of maximal rhetoric and strident attacks on
    capitalist imperialism, but no definite strategy was adopted for opposing
    the drive to war.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the extreme left of the Socialist International, Domela Nieuwenhuis of
    the Netherlands as early as 1891 had called for socialists to launch an
    armed insurrection in response to war. This call was later championed by
    French socialist Gustave Hervé, but with the outbreak of World War I Hervé
    flipped from this bombastic ultraleftism to an extreme French chauvinism.
    Then at the 1907 Stuttgart conference the old French Blanquist and Communard
    Edouard Vaillant, with the support of British Independent Labour Party
    leader Keir Hardie, moved an amendment calling for a general strike if war
    broke out. However revolutionaries like Lenin and Luxemburg recognised that
    the anarchist-style approach of Hervé was unworkable. A general strike or
    insurrection can’t be summoned on command at the best of times, let alone in
    the face of nationalist euphoria provoked by a declaration of war. As for
    talk of a general strike by reformists like Hardie, that was dismissed as
    hot air. The right-wing socialists also naturally denounced calls for a
    general strike or other forms of militant action. They did not want to
    commit to <em>any</em> concrete measures against war.
  </p>
  <p>
    Little in the way of practical activity to lay the basis for concerted
    opposition to war was developed by the Second International parties, despite
    a prolonged arms race in the early twentieth century. This was to a
    considerable part due to the approach of the leadership of the German SPD,
    easily the most influential party in the International. The young radical
    Karl Liebknecht did commence an anti-militarist campaign in Germany in 1904,
    publishing his crusading polemic

    There were a few other examples of anti-war agitation by the international
    left. In France the syndicalist-led trade union federation, the General
    Confederation of Labour (CGT), which was not affiliated to the Socialist
    International, to its credit did for some years concertedly campaign against
    militarism and conscription. But it too gradually began to make its peace
    with the capitalist system, and like the French Socialist Party capitulated
    at the outbreak of war. In 1905 the Swedish Social Democrats called on
    workers to launch a general strike if the government carried out its threat
    to invade Norway after it declared independence from Sweden. In Italy the
    Socialist Party expelled right-wing supporters of the Italian invasion of
    Libya in 1912. In Australia the small socialist movement campaigned against
    so-called “boy conscription” in the pre-war years, with some activists being
    jailed.<sup

    However these were exceptions that went against the grain of the
    International’s passivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    From about 1907 the SPD increasingly accommodated to German nationalism and
    colonialism. The right-wing revisionists in the party opposed abolishing the
    colonies as a “utopia” and claimed that German imperialism was a progressive
    force bringing “European civilisation” to the colonies. Edward David, a
    leading revisionist, argued at the 1907 Stuttgart Congress of the
    International that “Europe needs colonies. It does not have enough of them”.
    The revisionists in turn were backed by the powerful trade union leaders.
    Opposition to colonialism was only narrowly carried by a vote of 127 to 108
    at the Stuttgart Congress, with SPD delegates making up much of the
    pro-colonial minority.<sup

    The International never clearly declared that “defence of the fatherland”
    did not apply to imperialist war, and even sections on the SPD left in these
    pre-war years still clung to the concept of national defence. Much of the
    SPD left and the international far left in this period backed pacifist
    appeals for international disarmament and for an international court of
    arbitration to settle disputes between the Great Powers. These utopian
    reformist positions were voted up unanimously at the 1907 Stuttgart Congress
    of the International, though in 1911 Rosa Luxemburg polemicised against such
    pacifist illusions in her article <em>Peace Utopias</em>.<sup

    One of the first serious tests came with the 1911 Morocco crisis, when the
    German navy cruiser <em>Panther</em> sailed into Agadir harbour in a direct
    challenge to France’s imperialist interests in North Africa. The centrist
    SPD leadership did not want to speak out, fearful of an electoral backlash.
    But in the major German cities where the SPD left was strong protests were
    organised and the central leadership were eventually forced to back the
    protests after Luxemburg exposed their prevarication. The Morocco crisis did
    not only expose the backsliding of the SPD. The Socialist International took
    no initiative. It was entirely passive in the face of the war threat – a
    clear sign of what was to come.<sup

  <p>
    Then in April 1913, in a secret meeting of the budget committee of the
    German Reichstag, the Social Democrats present did not protest when the
    army’s plans for an offensive in the west at the beginning of a war were
    revealed to them. In the same year, after a heated debate in its
    parliamentary caucus, the SPD for the first time voted to support new taxes
    to fund increased arms spending, using the excuse that the money was to be
    raised by an income tax rather than indirect taxes that disproportionately
    hit workers and the poor.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem, however, was not just the right wing of the socialist movement.
    In 1912 Karl Kautsky, the most prominent socialist theorist of the day and a
    leading representative of the SPD centre, abandoned his previous opposition
    to any war by the German state, whether offensive or defensive. Where he had
    once argued that socialists could not make a meaningful distinction between
    the two, Kautsky now backed party leader August Bebel’s support for any
    supposedly defensive war by Germany. Kautsky argued that no proletariat
    could remain indifferent to the fate of the nation in the event of
    invasion.<sup

        ><span class="floating-ref-link"

    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Kautsky also began to develop his theory of ultra-imperialism, which he
    argued could supersede the imperialist phase of capitalist development.
    Kautsky claimed that the increasing economic integration of capitalist
    industry across national borders and the massive expansion of world trade
    and investment made a full-scale war unlikely. It would be more profitable,
    he argued, for the emerging giant capitalist monopolies to peacefully divide
    up the world between themselves rather than to support wars by rival nation
    states. A rehashed version of this economic determinist theory was put
    forward in recent decades by the autonomist Toni Negri, and in more recent
    times these ideas have been used to dismiss the danger of war between the US
    and China.<sup

    Kautsky polemicised against the argument made by the SPD’s revolutionary
    left that “war is strictly linked to the essence of capitalism”.<sup

    He claimed that rearmament was not an economic necessity of capitalist
    development, but was rather the result of a specific economic policy due to
    the weight commanded by particular forces in the state. Kautsky claimed that
    only a few sectors of capital, above all finance capital and the arms
    manufacturers, supported war and that they could potentially be disciplined
    by the dominant sections of the industrial capitalist class that had no
    interest in conflict.<sup

    This, in his view, opened up the possibility of an alliance against war
    between socialists and progressive capitalists. It was therefore necessary
    “to support and strengthen the movements of the petty bourgeoisie and
    bourgeoisie against war and the world arms race”.<sup

    To aid these developments socialists should in turn focus on campaigning for
    arms control and the arbitration of international disputes. Even after the
    outbreak of World War I, the greatest slaughter in human history, had
    decisively refuted his argument that a peaceful capitalism was possible,
    Kautsky published an article arguing:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There is no <em>economic</em> necessity for continuing the arms race after
      the World War, even from the standpoint of the capitalist class itself,
      with the possible exception of certain armaments interests. On the
      contrary, the capitalist economy is seriously threatened precisely by
      these disputes. Every far-sighted capitalist today must call on his
      fellows: capitalists of all countries unite!<sup

    Well before the war the most militant section of the SPD left and of the
    Socialist International around figures like Rosa Luxemburg had developed a
    more rigorous critique of imperialism. However the lefts tended to
    concentrate their fire against the right-wing revisionists and did not
    clearly differentiate themselves from the Kautskyite centre. Compounding the
    problem was the fact that the reactionary nature of Kautsky’s standpoint on
    imperialism was not immediately obvious even to a committed anti-militarist
    like Karl Liebknecht, who associated himself with Kautsky’s position at the
    SPD’s 1912 Chemnitz Congress.<sup

    It was only in the aftermath of the SPD’s 1913 Jena Congress that Luxemburg,
    who was the clearest, called for “a systematic offensive against the swamp
    [the Kautskyites]”.<sup
      ><sup

    As well, the lefts were hampered by the fact that most of them viewed party
    unity as sacrosanct and feared splits. The lefts also opposed a centralised
    international that might have been able to discipline the reformists. So the
    major political differences in the socialist movement were fudged until the
    war broke out. It has to be said that in the pre-war years even Lenin,
    despite his harsh criticisms of the German revisionists, still saw them as a
    legitimate shade in the International. Lenin also still had illusions in
    Kautsky and did not seriously attempt to organise an international left on
    clear lines. So while Lenin had split from the Menshevik reformists in
    Russia, he did not generalise that approach to the whole of the
    International, even though the reformists in Germany, Austria and France
    were in a series of ways politically worse than the Mensheviks.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the imperialist powers edged closer to war, the socialist parties,
    despite their strong working-class support bases in the major European
    states, were largely passive. They did not politically prepare their ranks
    to stridently combat the virus of nationalism. Reflecting how far they had
    accommodated to bourgeois society, many of the reformist leaders right up
    until the very outbreak of the war clung to illusions in the peaceful
    intentions of their own ruling classes. Bruce Glazier, a leader of the left
    reformist British Independent Labour Party, was still claiming in July 1914
    that the “whole of the [British] cabinet wants peace”. Leading French
    socialist Jean Jaurès declared in a speech on 29 July 1914: “the French
    government wants peace and works to maintain peace. It is the best ally of
    the peace efforts of the splendid British government”. On 30 July 1914 the
    SPD’s Berlin daily paper <em>Vorwärts</em> proclaimed that the German
    Emperor Wilhelm II “has proved himself to be a sincere partisan of
    international peace”.<sup

        ><span class="floating-ref-link"

    >
    Meanwhile the Austrian socialist leader, Victor Adler, had thrown up his
    hands in despair and abandoned any pretence of mounting resistance to the
    war drive. Having passively accepted the build-up to war it was no great
    leap for the leaders of the major parties to go over to outright support for
    their own nation once the war had been officially declared.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding to the pressure to capitulate was the surge of middle-class pro-war
    hysteria, the threat of harsh repressive measures that would destroy the
    unions, the parties and all the working-class institutions built up in
    peaceful times. By 1914 the German SPD had a million members, an apparatus
    that employed 10,000 people and investments of 20 million marks in its
    various enterprises, all of which were threatened if the party was
    outlawed.<sup
      ><sup
        ><span class="floating-ref-link"

            >19</a
          ></span
        ></sup
      ></sup
    >
    Thus the SPD could go from organising mass demonstrations against the threat
    of war in July 1914 to unanimously voting for war appropriations only a
    couple of weeks later, following the declaration of war on Russia. The
    German workers who had heroically defied police violence to protest in huge
    numbers against the war were left totally abandoned by their leaders. The
    SPD left, paralysed by their commitment to party unity and discipline,
    offered no alternative.
  </p>
  <p>
    The SPD’s capitulation had a profoundly demoralising impact on
    socialist-inspired workers right across Europe. The party that had been held
    up as the beacon of hope for workers, the party that other smaller socialist
    parties had aspired to emulate, had now betrayed. In Russia militant
    workers, who in the face of savage police repression and brutal assaults by
    middle-class mobs had been striking and protesting against the war, were
    thoroughly disoriented when the news came through of the SPD’s vote for war
    credits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The opportunists sought to cover up their warmongering with a left-wing
    gloss and came up with an array of theoretical justifications for their
    betrayals. In voting for war credits the SPD Reichstag faction declared that
    Germany was fighting a war of self-defence and pathetically hoped that the
    war would be ended “by a peace which makes friendship possible with
    neighbouring peoples”.<sup
      ><sup
        ><span class="floating-ref-link"

            >20</a
          ></span
        ></sup
      ></sup
    >
    The opportunists in Austria and Germany also dredged up Marx and Engels’
    hostility to tsarism. A German victory, it was claimed, would advance the
    interests of workers in both Russia and Germany by provoking a revolution to
    overthrow tsarism. In France and Britain leading socialists declared that
    they were fighting a defensive war against reactionary Prussian militarism.
    That wasn’t a total lie; the war was a defence of their ruling classes’
    colonial conquests from the rising power of Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the leaders of the centre in the SPD and the other socialist parties
    backed the initial vote to support the war, but were somewhat shamefaced
    about it. As the war dragged on and working-class discontent increasingly
    surfaced, sections of the centre began verbally to drift to the left to
    cover their tracks. They began to talk of a “democratic peace”, of a
    negotiated settlement “without victors or vanquished” and to reject
    annexations. In June 1915 Kautsky, Haase and even Bernstein of the SPD came
    out for a negotiated peace. Later, after being driven out of the SPD by the
    vitriolic pro-war right, they found themselves on the right wing of the
    centrist Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD).
  </p>
  <h2>Debates on the revolutionary left</h2>
  <p>
    The scale of the betrayal by the leading parties of the Socialist
    International left the small bands of socialists that held firm to
    internationalist principles shocked and initially extremely isolated. Lenin
    at first refused to believe reports that the SPD had voted for war credits.
    The revolutionaries were confronted with the task of developing a
    thoroughgoing critique of imperialism and socialist opportunism, combined
    with a strategic and tactical approach to the struggle against the war. “The
    result”, in R Craig Nation’s words, “was one of the most intense and
    creative debates in the entire history of socialist thought, a debate about
    alternative visions of revolutionary transformation in the circumstances of
    the twentieth century”.<sup

    >
    These debates are of ongoing relevance in light of the sharp accentuation of
    imperialist rivalry between the US and China.
  </p>
  <p>
    The revolutionary left all agreed on three key points: first, that this was
    an imperialist war that had to be opposed by workers in all the combatant
    countries; second, that the leaders of the social democratic parties had
    betrayed the working class; and third, that a workers’ revolution was needed
    to end the war and the whole system of capitalism that bred wars. However
    there was a series of at times strident debates: over revolutionary
    defeatism, the peace slogan, the disarmament slogan, national liberation
    struggles and the need for a clear break with the reformists and centrists
    to form a new revolutionary socialist international.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lenin rightly spent the early years of the war establishing a hard-left pole
    of attraction that made no concessions to opportunists, and combated any
    illusions about achieving peace without workers’ revolutions. He sought to
    draw a sharp line between revolutionaries and pacifists who believed the war
    could be ended on just terms through negotiations

    Revolutionary defeatism is commonly held up as the core element of Lenin’s
    opposition to the imperialist war. However he used the term much less
    frequently than is commonly portrayed, and even before he arrived back in
    Russia in the wake of the February 1917 revolution he had dropped talk of
    defeatism. Prominent Bolsheviks disagreed with Lenin on the defeatism
    slogan, and not just waverers or more conservative figures such as Kamenev.
    The left of the party around Bukharin, Krylenko, Piatakov and Bosch also
    opposed it.<sup

    Zinoviev was one of the few leading Bolsheviks who backed Lenin. In terms of
    the activity of Bolshevik militants on the ground in Russia during the war
    years revolutionary defeatism seems to have played little or no role.
    According to one study:

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      A textual analysis of forty-seven leaflets and appeals published illegally
      by Bolshevik militants between January 1915 and 22 February 1917 is most

      of the defeat of Russia being the lesser evil.<sup

    The Communist International in its early revolutionary years did not adopt
    revolutionary defeatism in relation to imperialist wars. Revolutionary
    defeatism was only revived in 1924 as a cynical manoeuvre by the troika of
    Zinoviev, Kamenev and Stalin in their campaign against Trotsky and as part
    of their authoritarian drive to “Bolshevise” the Comintern and crush all
    revolutionary opposition.<sup

    The Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928 fully installed defeatism and it
    subsequently was turned into a dogma by the Stalinists.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lenin changed his position a series of times on what revolutionary defeatism
    concretely meant and flip-flopped back and forth between substantially
    different meanings of the slogan. At the outbreak of the war he supported
    the military defeat of Russia by German imperialism, which he saw as the
    lesser evil compared to reactionary tsarism – essentially Marx’s old
    position. Bukharin pointed out that this was effectively the same position
    as the German SPD leadership which also backed a German military victory
    using a similar justification. Lenin retreated in the face of this criticism
    to a position that workers not only of Russia but of every belligerent
    country “must not falter at the possibility of that country’s defeat”.<sup

    Lenin began to call on socialists to take a position of revolutionary
    defeatism in all the contesting powers, though he explicitly ruled out the
    use of sabotage of the war effort. He also briefly

    Later he changed his stance again, stating that all revolutionary defeatism
    meant was that socialists should not hold back the class struggle out of
    fear of jeopardising the imperialist war effort of their government. This,
    however, was no different from the position of Trotsky, Luxemburg, Radek and
    Co., whom he had sharply criticised earlier.

    As Trotsky pointed out, socialists could oppose the war and support

    It was undoubtedly necessary for revolutionary Marxists to draw a sharp line
    between themselves and reformists and centrists who hid behind pacifist
    slogans to disguise their unwillingness to back mass working-class struggle
    to end the war. That objective, however, could be achieved without embracing
    the ultra-radical sounding but disorienting slogan of revolutionary
    defeatism.
  </p>

    The last time Lenin publicly raised the defeatism slogan was in November
    1916. Back in Russia in April 1917 Lenin recognised that the Bolsheviks were
    not going to win over the mass of workers and soldiers by proclaiming
    maximalist slogans. The working masses wanted peace, but they also feared
    that a German military victory would result in the defeat of the Russian
    revolution. Indeed by September 1917 sections of the Russian bourgeoisie
    hoped for a German invasion to crush the Bolsheviks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lenin also changed his position on the peace slogan. At the start of the war
    he stridently

    >
    against the peace slogan and counterposed to it the slogan of “turn the
    imperialist war into civil war”. “Not ‘peace without annexations’”, he
    proclaimed, “but peace to the cottages, war on the palaces; peace to the
    proletariat and the toiling masses, war on the bourgeoisie”.<sup

    Lenin saw the call for peace raised by centrists like Kautsky as being in
    direct opposition to a workers’ revolution which was the only way to end the
    war. As he wrote in a
    <a

      previewlistener="true"
      >letter</a
    >
    to his fellow Bolshevik Shlyapnikov: “The watchword of peace, in my opinion,
    is incorrect at the present moment. It is a philistine, parson’s watchword.
    The proletarian watchword must be civil war”.<sup

  </p>
  <p>
    Lenin rightly pointed out that in a capitalist world the only peace possible
    was an “imperialist peace” based on the balance of forces between the Great
    Powers. Lenin attacked Kautsky’s call for a “democratic peace” as a utopian
    demand which simply created illusions in the imperialist governments and
    deflected from the need for revolutionary struggle. The reformist leaders
    claimed they were for a “democratic peace” that involved the renunciation of
    all annexations and war reparations. But this simply meant supporting the
    pre-war imperialist status quo – the existing division of the spoils of
    empire.
  </p>
  <p>
    On similar grounds Lenin opposed calls for universal disarmament and the
    international arbitration of disputes that had been unanimously adopted at
    the 1910 Congress of the Second International and which was still advocated
    by sections of the revolutionary left. The Norwegian and Swedish Socialist
    Youth League, which was an important component of the Zimmerwald left,
    continued to be influenced by this pacifist position. Universal disarmament,
    however, is impossible under imperialism, and even if capitalism was
    overthrown in one or two countries, the new workers’ states would need to be
    armed to defend themselves. As well, Lenin rightly argued that socialists
    should not demand the disarmament of colonial and nationally oppressed
    peoples. Unlike many on the revolutionary left, including Luxemburg, Radek
    and Bukharin, Lenin backed armed national rebellions in colonies such as
    Ireland and India and by the oppressed nations of the Russian empire. He
    understood that those national revolts could play an important role in
    challenging capitalist rule. As for international arbitration, in a
    class-based society there was no genuinely neutral body capable of justly
    settling disputes, and any decision would merely reflect the balance of
    imperialist forces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lenin was correct to argue that talk of a democratic peace, disarmament and
    the like was utopian under capitalism. War could only be ended under
    socialism. It was undoubtedly true that Kautsky and Co. were raising these
    slogans in opposition to a strategy of working-class struggle to end the war
    and the capitalist system that bred it. But that did not entirely settle the
    issue. As discontent rose over the collapse of living standards, food
    shortages, falling wages, incredibly harsh working conditions, conscription,
    the slaughter at the front and the crushing of democratic rights, workers
    and the mass of the oppressed increasingly demanded peace. Revolutionaries
    could not turn their backs on those demands. As Trotsky wrote in August 1916
    in criticism of Lenin’s approach:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      [E]xperience shows that the mobilization of proletarian opposition
      everywhere has taken place precisely under this slogan [the struggle for
      peace]. Only on this basis can revolutionary internationalists today
      successfully carry out their work. The formula of
      <em>civil war</em> expresses in an essentially correct way the inevitable
      exacerbation of all forms of class struggle in the coming period. But they
      [the Bolsheviks] counterpose it to the struggle for peace, which causes
      the formula to hang in mid-air and lose its meaning for the period we are
      going through.<sup

  <p>
    Workers were not demanding peace out of cynical pro-imperialist motivations
    but out of heartfelt concerns. They were not looking to prop up capitalism.
    The Bolsheviks in their agitation in the factories could not simply denounce
    calls for peace as utopian. That would have cut them off from the masses
    they needed to win over and driven them back into the arms of the
    opportunists. Once he was back in Russia Lenin clearly recognised this. The
    Bolsheviks could not simply proclaim: “Turn the imperialist war into a civil
    war” to the millions who were yearning for peace and an end to the war. It
    was way too maximal. Lenin now
    <a

      previewlistener="true"
      >criticised</a

    the previous Bolshevik orientation with its insistence on hard formulations
    as too theoretical and abstract an approach:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The masses take a practical and not a theoretical approach to the
      question. We make the mistake of taking the theoretical approach…
    </p>
    <p>
      We Bolsheviks are in the habit of taking the line of
      <a id="bookmark=id.gjdgxs"></a>maximum revolutionism. But that is not
      enough. We must sort things out.<sup

  <p>
    More concrete demands and transitional slogans were necessary that
    constructively related to mass sentiment and sought to move it forward in a
    revolutionary direction. The Bolsheviks’ practical program became: no class
    peace; no participation in war-time governments; no war credits; carrying
    out illegal work; and encouraging fraternisation at the front between troops
    of the opposing armies. The key Bolshevik slogans for the October Revolution
    famously became: “Bread, Peace and Land”, combined with the means to achieve
    these goals: “All Power to the Soviets”.
  </p>
  <p>
    This concrete program was a product of the tactical flexibility of Lenin and
    the Bolsheviks as they applied their principled revolutionary politics to
    the realities of the class struggle and the emerging consciousness of the
    working masses as they moved towards revolutionary conclusions. Maximalist
    ultimatums were of no use. Revolutionaries had to patiently win workers to a
    series of transitional steps that led to them ultimately taking power.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the aftermath of the February revolution the Bolsheviks were confronted
    with another vital issue – what Lenin called the
    <a

    sentiments of many soldiers and workers.<sup

    >
    These soldiers believed it was necessary to fight on, not for the
    imperialist goal of seizing territory, but to protect the gains of the
    revolution. The Bolsheviks did not retreat at all from their determined
    opposition to the war, but they had to relate to these genuine concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Bolsheviks did not call for mutinies in the army or desertions from the
    front. The war would not be ended by soldiers simply “sticking their
    bayonets in the ground” or abandoning the front – that was pure demagogy, an
    anarchist or pacifist idea. The war could only be ended by revolutions in
    several countries. The first step would be for workers and soldiers to take
    power in Russia. In the short term that meant forming soldiers’ soviets,
    fraternisation with the enemy and opposing reckless offensives ordered by
    the Provisional Government that sacrificed thousands of lives in pursuit of
    an imperialist agenda of territorial conquests. In a similar vein, in May
    1917 Lenin
    <a
      href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/07b.htm"
      previewlistener="true"
      >called on the peasants</a
    >
    to seize the land, but added that they should do so “using every effort to
    increase the production of grain and meat since the troops at the front are
    in dire straits”.<sup

        ><span class="floating-ref-link"

    The point here is that individual refusal to work or fight was no step
    forward: the socialist solution to these immense problems could only be
    found through collective action and the democratic transformation of
    society.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach was soon to be tested. In the months before the October
    revolution top tsarist officers conspired to open the front for the Germans
    to capture St Petersburg. And as John Reed

  <h2>Zimmerwald and a new International</h2>
  <p>
    As an internationalist Lenin was not narrowly focused on developments in
    Russia during the war years. With the collapse of the Second International
    into support for the war Lenin immediately came out calling for a new
    revolutionary international. At the start of the war the forces of the
    revolutionary left were far too small to make that a practical proposition.
    Small openings for the revolutionary left emerged in March and April 1915 at
    the International Conference of Socialist Women and the International
    Socialist Youth Conference, which were both to the left of the mainstream of
    the Socialist International. At the women’s conference Inessa Armand pursued
    what was to become the broad tactical orientation of the Bolsheviks at a
    series of international left conferences: “challenging the dominant moderate
    consensus but striving to avoid an open breach”. Their goal was “to use the
    conferences as a platform to air an alternative viewpoint, to recruit
    supporters and to exert some influence on the final resolutions”.<sup
      ><sup
        ><span class="floating-ref-link"
          ><a

      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The women’s and youth conferences helped lay the basis for the first serious
    step forward for the anti-war left, the September 1915 Zimmerwald conference
    in Switzerland. The bulk of the small group of attendees at Zimmerwald did
    not advocate revolutionary struggle to end the war. They mostly held
    centrist-style positions, and did not see themselves as laying the basis for
    a new International. The key figure behind the Zimmerwald movement, Robert
    Grimm of the Swiss Socialist Party, stood for “class struggle not civil
    truce” but he was not a revolutionary and opposed splits in the socialist
    parties. The conservative wing of Zimmerwald was represented by figures such
    as the SPD parliamentarian Georg Ledebour who, although he was to the left
    of Kautsky, had up to this point voted for war credits. Ledebour and the
    left Menshevik Martov were for restoring the International around the common
    denominator of peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even some more left-wing delegates, such as Trotsky, the Romanian, Christian
    Rakovsky, who went on later to become a leading Bolshevik, and Vasil
    Kolarov, subsequently a leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party, did not
    join the Zimmerwald left bloc that Lenin laboriously fought to cohere. In a
    few cases this was because they did not want at this stage to totally cut
    off their links with the Second International. Trotsky, for example, despite
    having a thoroughly revolutionary standpoint in opposition to the war, still
    held onto illusions in the possibility of unity of Russian socialists.
    Recognising this reality, Lenin in the lead-up to Zimmerwald had toned down
    his conditions for affiliation to the left bloc to: (1) unconditional
    condemnation of opportunism and social chauvinism; (2) a revolutionary
    action program (with the concession that whether one preferred the slogan
    “mass strike” or “civil war” was of secondary importance); (3) refutation of
    defence of the Fatherland.<sup

    Notably this program did not call for revolutionary defeatism or a break
    with the Second International and the foundation of a Third International.
    Nor did it call for support of struggles for national self-determination
    which significant figures in the left bloc, such as Radek, still opposed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Zimmerwald manifesto, which was drafted by Trotsky, was a compromise. It
    raised the democratic peace slogans and did not call for a revolutionary
    civil war. The Zimmerwald left voted for the manifesto as they saw its call
    to struggle as a step forward. Nonetheless they publicly

    it for saying nothing critical about the socialist opportunists and for not
    offering a clear pronouncement about the methods for fighting against the
    war.<sup

        ><span class="floating-ref-link"

  </p>
  <p>
    Zimmerwald played an important role in reviving the spirit of the anti-war
    left and the first minimal steps had been taken in establishing a left bloc
    of revolutionary opponents of the war. By the time of the second conference
    of the Zimmerwald movement in April 1916 at Kienthal, also in Switzerland,
    the tide had shifted substantially to the left, with an upsurge of
    working-class protests and strikes over the appalling deterioration of
    living standards, incredibly long working hours, food shortages and the
    never-ending war. The resolution on peace adopted at Kienthal was more
    radical than the Zimmerwald one, with a call for the overthrow of the
    capitalist class, a more explicit call for a vote against war credits and a
    description of arms controls and compulsory arbitration of international
    disputes as mere utopias. The actual Kienthal manifesto, however, did not
    fully reflect this shift and the issue of breaking with the Socialist
    International was still fudged. The right wing had threatened to walk out of
    the conference if a vote to split from the International Socialist Bureau
    was carried.
  </p>
  <p>
    The arguments of the left bloc organised by Lenin were gaining a broader
    hearing as events unfolded and the class struggle increasingly broke out.
    The Zimmerwald left, despite an ongoing lack of cohesion, was increasingly
    critical of the socialist centre and was pulling in new forces including
    Giacinto Serratti, the editor of the Italian socialist paper
    <em>Avanti!</em>, three Swiss delegates and a prominent Serbian socialist.
    The basis was being laid for the formation of the Communist International.
    The revolutionaries’ argument that the war could be ended by working-class
    revolts was to be decisively proved correct over the next two years by the
    October 1917 revolution in Russia, the November 1918 German revolution and a
    series of further revolts that swept across Europe and much of the world.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The fundamental principles of the Marxist approach to war and imperialism
    developed in response to World War I have substantially stood the test of
    time. Socialists must oppose both sides in all wars between imperialist
    powers, support the mobilisation of mass opposition to such wars and stand
    for ending war and the capitalist system that breeds it by working-class
    revolution. Lenin’s strategic orientation of “turn the imperialist war into
    a civil war” remains correct.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not enough, however, to make abstract calls for a revolutionary
    challenge to imperialism. Militant action against militarism and war is
    vital. Socialists also need to develop specific slogans and transitional
    demands that can help galvanise opposition to any specific war and assist
    workers to draw the conclusion that they need to overthrow capitalism.
    Socialists have to relate to all the partial struggles of workers and the
    oppressed around the issues of falling living standards, the deterioration
    of wages and working conditions, the undermining of democratic rights and
    racist scapegoating brought on by the war, as these can help to lay the
    basis for a powerful anti-war movement. Maximalist rhetoric should not be
    counterposed to calls for peace, opposition to preparations for war and the
    basic defence of living standards, especially when those calls are not the
    cynical rhetoric of opportunist politicians but arise from the mass of
    workers and the oppressed. The specific slogans socialists raise will
    necessarily depend on the concrete political circumstances of the day. They
    will be significantly different in a period leading up to war, like the
    present, and the period after the actual outbreak of shooting.
  </p>
  <p>
    One important modification of the Marxist approach to war has been
    necessitated by the development of nuclear weaponry. Nuclear weapons are
    qualitatively different from conventional weaponry in their destructive
    capacity. Unlike rifles or machine guns, they are not weapons that the
    working class or a workers’ state can simply turn against the bourgeoisie.
    Indeed, an all-out nuclear war would threaten the very destruction of our
    planet and the entire human race. For these reasons socialists should
    definitely campaign for nuclear disarmament. In countries which already have
    nuclear weapons the demand of socialists must be the unilateral nuclear
    disarmament of their own ruling class. In countries, like Australia, which
    don’t currently have nuclear weapons, socialists should stridently oppose
    any move by their ruling class to acquire them.
  </p>
  <p>
    As in 1914, there is in the world today no neutral or independent body that
    can be looked to for the just arbitration of disputes between the
    imperialist powers or prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The United
    Nations, to which many liberals and pacifists appeal to prevent wars, has
    been utterly ineffective. The UN is after all a gathering of our enemies –
    the ruling classes of the world. The UN Security Council is dominated by the
    major imperialist powers and, as has been shown repeatedly, if one of the
    major powers, such as the US, cannot get its way on the Security Council it
    will act unilaterally. Mass action remains the only option to challenge the
    drive to war, and the threat of war can ultimately only be ended by workers
    taking power out of the hands of the capitalist classes of the whole world.
