      “It’s tough being a member of the Squad these days”, wrote Branko Marcetic
      last year in the pages of <em>Jacobin</em> <em>Magazine</em>, lamenting
      the fact that “even committed socialists question what the point of the
      Squad has been”.<sup

      <a id="_Hlk163570293"></a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s successful bid to
      unseat long-term Democratic powerbroker Joe Crowley from his New York
      congressional seat in June 2018 had unleashed an avalanche of expectations
      on the American reformist left. Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC, was joined by
      three other successful progressive challengers.
      <a id="_Hlk163570307"></a>Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley,
      were, together with AOC, dubbed “the Squad” by the media.
      <em>Jacobin Magazine</em> – a publication aligned with the Democratic
      Socialists of America (DSA) – presented the victory of AOC and her
      colleagues as vindication of their longstanding claim that the Democratic
      Party could be the unlikely site of a new socialist movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles Kampf-Lassin wrote: “it’s no shock that Ocasio-Cortez and her cohort
      are being treated as a threat to a party establishment that has cozied up
      to corporate power and helped maintain the deeply unequal economic and
      political order in this country. It’s because they are one”.<sup

      In another article, AOC was called “a righteous disturber of the peace, an
      adept orator for the working class, a creative user of new platforms.
      Though still on the periphery of power, she is showing us a different kind
      of politics. Instead of accommodating herself to the powers that be, she’s
      expanding people’s sense of the possible”.<sup

      Her role was even compared to the heroic period of the German Social
      Democratic Party, a socialist workers’ party which claimed a million
      members in the early twentieth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years later, the Squad has lost its sheen. Rather than taking the
      hammer to the Democratic establishment, the Squad has become its
      enthusiastic left flank. AOC has endorsed Biden for re-election, stating
      in a recent interview with CNN: “I know who I’m going to choose. It’s
      going to be one of the most successful presidents in modern American
      history”.<sup

      Commitment to party unity has meant accepting the Biden administration’s
      right-wing domestic and international agenda, from voting to unilaterally
      impose a contract on railway workers and quash their right to strike, to
      voting to fund Israel’s Iron Dome.

    <p>
      What the hell happened to the group that was supposed to “burn it down”,
      in the words of one of AOC’s staffers?
    </p>
    <p>
      The new American reformist clique around <em>Jacobin</em> has portrayed
      the Squad as insurgent leftists trying to confront the Democratic Party
      machine. Ryan Grim’s new book
      <em>The Squad: AOC and the Hope of a Political Revolution</em> is
      different. Grim is an effusive supporter of AOC’s attempts to rehabilitate
      the Democrats. But unlike the <em>Jacobin</em> crowd, he makes no attempt
      to disguise the Squad as a genuine challenge to the Party machine. His
      work is useful for revolutionaries, not because it condemns the Squad, but
      because it provides candid evidence that can furnish a radical critique.
      The book proves, intentionally or not, that the Squad are nothing more
      than moderate and aspirational liberal Democrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grim’s account describes how each member of the Squad established their
      careers within the Democratic Party machine. Ayanna Pressley worked her
      way up as an intern for a member of the Kennedy dynasty, before becoming
      political director for John Kerry, one-time Presidential hopeful and
      current US climate envoy. Rashida Tlaib worked as a Democratic staffer
      from 2004, eventually serving in Congress in Michigan, while Ilhan Omar
      did the same in Minnesota from 2013. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez interned for
      Ted Kennedy, before establishing a Bronx-based company publishing
      children’s books. In 2012 AOC appeared alongside Democratic Senator
      Kirsten Gillibrand at a press conference unveiling a tax break for new
      businesses; as Gillibrand intoned: “We know that government doesn’t create
      jobs, businesses do”. In a weak defence of AOC’s working-class
      credentials, Grim dismisses this awkward history by emphasising her
      one-time stint in the hospitality industry, adding: “Despite her earlier
      ambitions, by this point in her life, the proper way to understand
      Ocasio-Cortez was as a bartender” (ch. 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squad’s breakthrough came two years after the insurgent campaign by
      Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders began
      his campaign with a series of scathing attacks on the Democratic
      establishment, but by July 2016 had endorsed Hillary Clinton, championing
      the neoliberal warmonger’s policy platform as “the most progressive in
      history”.<sup

          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

              class="reference-body-link"
              >5</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      AOC serves as the major focus of Grim’s book, reflecting her role as the
      leading and most influential member of the grouping. One of AOC’s first
      acts was her early occupation of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office
      alongside climate activists from the Sunrise Movement. Grim shows that
      even this disruptive action was couched within an approach which sought to
      gently nudge the party in the right direction. When asked whether her
      occupation was a direct challenge to Pelosi (and by extension the
      Democratic establishment), AOC replied: “One of the things I admire so
      much about Leader Pelosi is that she comes from a space of activism and
      organising, and so I think that she really appreciates civic engagement.
      And really what I’m here to do is just to support the folks who are here”;
      adding “Should Leader Pelosi become the next Speaker of the House, we need
      to tell her that we’ve got her back” (ch. 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squad did indeed have Pelosi’s back. They supported the venture
      capitalist – who has an estimated net worth upwards of $100m – for
      re-election as party leader at the end of 2018. Soon AOC had christened
      her the “mama bear” of the Democratic Party. This established a pattern:
      members of the Squad would trade loyalty to the Democratic leadership for
      a shot at sitting in on influential Congressional Committees. AOC soon
      began withholding endorsements for other progressive primary challengers,
      and funnelling money from her “Courage to Change” fundraising committee to
      centrists. In 2023 the Squad unanimously backed Pelosi’s successor, Hakeem
      Jeffries, whose extreme hostility to the left was infamous in progressive
      circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time, the steadfast loyalty of the Democratic Party’s left wing
      contrasted awkwardly with dynamics playing out on the other side of the
      aisle. The far-right Freedom Caucus was giving a masterclass in
      obstructionism, blocking the election of establishment Republican Kevin
      McCarthy to the House Speaker position for days on end. AOC was forced to
      respond to an obvious question: Why doesn’t the Democratic left fight
      their leaders as hard as the Republican right fight theirs? Her response
      was revealing:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        When people say, you know, why don’t we do this? First of all, there’s a
        lot of cost and dysfunction… Second of all, those people who are holding
        out right now, they may have made certain structural gains, but they
        have also made incredible reputational and relational harm within their
        caucus. And so, if you are trying to get something done within your
        caucus moving forward, you still need members of your caucus. And that,
        at the core, is an element of electoral politics that is simply
        inescapable (ch. 20).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      While some issues created tension between the Squad and the Democratic
      leadership, this was never translated into an open political battle. AOC
      ruffled feathers by referring to the Israeli “occupation of Palestine” in
      a 2018 interview. But since then, she has waffled and evaded on the issue,
      culminating in her 2021 decision to vote “present” rather than “no” on a
      vote to fund Israel’s Iron Dome. This shocked many in left-Democratic
      circles, sparking debate about whether this represented a capitulation, or
      some subtle tactical masterstroke. The rationale that Ocasio-Cortez
      herself provided is far more banal: “I felt voting P[resent] was the only
      way I could maintain some degree of peace at home – enough to bring folks
      together to the table[,] because all this whipped things up to an all out
      war” (ch. 18). Maintaining friendly relations with right-wing Democrats
      and upholding party unity trumped principle and the possibility of
      mobilising sentiment against the craven pro-Israel politics of the
      Democratic establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relationship between the Democratic left and centre was consummated
      under Biden. After swiftly dispensing with the half-hearted challenge from
      Bernie Sanders in the 2020 primaries, he moved to co-opt the left and
      adopt some elements of their rhetoric as part of his policy agenda. AOC
      joined Biden’s “climate unity” task force with John Kerry, while Sanders
      was handed a plum spot on the Senate Budget Committee. Grim writes: “while
      Ocasio-Cortez and the Squad spent much of 2019 in conflict with party
      leadership, and spent the first half of 2020 trying to nominate Sanders
      for president, AOC had been a team player in the general election, and
      through Biden’s term, she had consistently framed her advocacy as in
      support of his administration and his agenda” (ch. 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Grim presents Biden’s suite of economic and social policies, dubbed
      “Bidenomics” by the press, as a victory for the left, something at least
      approximating the reformist vision of a Green New Deal. US socialist
      Ashley Smith argues that Bidenomics should better be understood as a
      project of “imperialist Keynesianism” – a capitalist project which
      includes three connected goals: “1) rebuilding the foundations of U.S.
      capitalism, 2) stabilizing domestic politics under the hegemony of the
      Democratic Party, and 3) restoring and protecting Washington’s imperial
      supremacy over China and Russia.”<sup

    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than pulling Biden to the left, Sanders and the Squad were pulled
      to the right, abandoning their reformist program to cheerlead an
      administration overseeing attacks on workers at home and militarisation
      abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grim’s insider account reveals that this approach clashed with some of the
      expectations of AOC’s staffers who wanted a combative politics: “Her staff
      and many of the backers of Justice Democrats wanted to go to war against
      the people they saw as in the way of progress, AOC’s one-time policy
      adviser Dan Riffle said. They wanted a real political revolution” (ch.
      10). In the end, AOC resolved this contradiction by replacing her two
      closest political advisers with Washington insiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grim’s book makes it clear that the “activist” sphere with which the Squad
      interacts is the well-heeled NGO-industrial complex. If anything, this
      exerts a further conservatising pressure on elected officials. Grim
      recounts one tragicomic example on the issue of abortion. AOC’s staffers
      considered bringing a vote to Congress to repeal the Hyde amendment,
      prohibiting federal funding for abortion services. This longstanding piece
      of legislation is defended by Biden. They were discouraged from pushing
      for the legislation’s repeal by Planned Parenthood lobbyists, who
      explained that if they brought forward a vote to repeal the law, the NGO
      would be forced to publicly criticise Democrats who voted to maintain it.
      This was something they were not keen on, and the vote was abandoned (ch.
      10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Could things have gone differently? Could more organised left-wing
      pressure on the Squad have pushed them towards a more principled path?
      Adam Sacks’ <em>Jacobin</em> article comparing AOC to the German Social
      Democrats suggested so, stressing that “Going forward, we’ll need
      nationwide networks of left politicians, real structures outside the
      Democratic Party, and a vibrant working-class movement that can groom the
      next generation of socialists”.<sup

        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      This statement has no relationship to the actual project of the Squad. As
      a grouping of elected officials, they have expressed no desire to foster
      independent organisations that can hold them to a baseline set of
      political principles. The organisations that helped propel the Squad into
      office, like the DSA and Justice Democrats, are ginger groups that operate
      within the framework of Democratic party politics, not independent
      working-class organisations. As the strategy of electing left Democrats
      has been exposed as a dead end, organisations built around this project
      have gone into decline. The DSA is mired in crisis, with falling
      membership, while Justice Democrats were forced in 2023 to lay off nearly
      half of their staff. Years of organisational investment into the Squad has
      only put left-wing organisations in the US in the discrediting position of
      feeling compelled to apologise for their unchecked backsliding and
      political capitulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than five years on from the shock election of the Squad, there is a
      need for a serious critique of their project. Much of the criticism of AOC
      in leftist circles focuses on individual outrages – from her rebranding of
      Trump’s migrant “concentration camps” as “overflow facilities” under
      Biden, to her rebuttals of left-wing criticisms of his administration as
      “privileged” and “bad faith”. While these statements are pretty repugnant,
      the left needs a deeper critique of the arguments mobilised to justify the
      Squad’s project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strategy promoted by the American reformists operating around the DSA
      is that the Democratic Party can be taken over, split or disrupted by
      socialists running in elections as Democrats. This is an utterly
      unrealistic, distorting and disorganising perspective for any serious
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democratic Party is the oldest and most established capitalist party
      in the world. Its list of crimes is the longest of any, given the party’s
      central role in administering one of the most brutal capitalist states on
      the planet – a state which has spent 80 years as the largest and most
      aggressive empire the world has ever known. The Democrats are the party of
      slavery and segregation, of Hiroshima and the wars on Vietnam and Gaza, of
      union-busting and austerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very name “Democratic Party” is an oxymoron. Its structures are
      profoundly undemocratic and it’s not really a party. Rather, it’s a series
      of fundraising cabals controlled by a powerful wing of the US capitalist
      class. The speed with which the Democratic Party apparatus mobilised to
      defeat Sanders after his surprise breakthrough in the 2020 Las Vegas
      primaries is evidence of the imperviousness of these structures to
      democratic will. No genuine socialist could politically operate within its
      institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This raises a broader question unexplored in Ryan Grim’s book and seldom
      touched in the pages of publications like <em>Jacobin</em>: what is a
      socialist? The label has been everywhere in the last decade. As an
      adjective, “socialist” appears 28 times in the book, reflecting its
      widespread adoption, even by very moderate politicians and organisations.
      The noun “socialism”, however, doesn’t appear once. It’s peculiar that a
      book covering five years of what has often been portrayed as an insurgent
      socialist movement doesn’t contain a single paragraph of discussion of
      socialism as a political objective, what it means and how to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socialism is about uprooting the capitalist system; it is about
      eliminating exploitation and doing away with the existing state. Socialism
      is a radical end that can only be achieved through radical means. To be a
      “socialist” requires a relentless hatred of the capitalist class and their
      institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best representatives of the socialist movement have always understood
      this. The American revolutionary Eugene Debs once said: “There was a time
      in my life, before I became a Socialist, when I permitted myself as a
      member of the Democratic party to be elected to a state legislature. I
      have been trying to live it down. I am as much ashamed of that as I am
      proud of having gone to jail.”<sup

    <p>
      The balance sheet of the Squad’s first five years shows that a grouping of
      aspirational, progressive political careerists can exist comfortably in
      the swamp of the Democratic Party, despite occasional ideological tensions
      and policy clashes. A socialist movement is something different – it will
      have to be built based on an implacable hostility to the oldest, most
      powerful capitalist party on the planet.
