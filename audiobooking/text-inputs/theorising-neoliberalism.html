  <h1>Theorising neoliberalism</h1>

  <hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

  <p class="fst">
    A new word <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> entered the vocabulary of the
    left in November 1999 with the momentous protest against the World Trade
    Organisation in Seattle – ”neoliberalism”.
    <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> Just as the movement that erupted at that
    protest defined itself as being against “globalisation” (or “corporate
    globalisation”), so it came to describe itself as “anti-neoliberal”. The far
    left took over this terminology, often describing economic policies it
    opposed as “neoliberal”.
  </p>

  <p>
    But there was an ambiguity in the term “neoliberal”. Did it refer to a way
    of running the capitalist system that could be changed with a change in
    government policy, or did it refer to something intrinsic to the present
    phase of capitalism that only challenging the system as whole could
    overcome? And was this present phase really described by the right wing
    “libertarian” anti-statist ideology of the neoliberals or was it a much more
    complex system of attacks?
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of the most influential thinkers in the post-Seattle movement accepted
    the first answer to both questions. Leaders of Attac in France said their
    organisation was not “anti-capitalist”, but merely wanted to stop short term
    financial flows disrupting national economies.
    <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> Bernard Cassen, founder of Attac, wanted a
    “protectionist” national economy organised along capitalist lines. Susan
    George would occasionally speak about capitalism, but could also write of
    “the harmful consequences of globalisation”, as if this were something
    separate from, and intrinsically worse than, capitalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    When it came to explaining what had changed since the 1960s, the emphasis
    tended to be on the victory of one ideology over another, rather than
    changes in the inner functioning of the global economic system. This was put
    very clearly by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. He argued, “The main
    issue is neoliberalism and the retreat of the state. In France neoliberal
    philosophy has become embedded in all the social practices and policies of
    the state”. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> This was “the effect of a shared
    belief ... which has created a climate favourable to the withdrawal of the
    state and so submission to the values of the economy”.
    <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The logic of this position was that all that was needed to reverse the
    unpleasant policies pursued by capitalist governments and corporations was a
    shift in ideology or politics at the top of society. Pressing for this could
    involve alliances with particular capitalist groups. Susan George spelt this
    out in theory, writing that “sometimes the allies may even be ...
    transnationals” such as those in the insurance industry.
    <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> Bernard Cassen applied this in practice by
    giving electoral support to the former French defence minister Jean-Pierre
    Chevènement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such approaches contrasted sharply with the analyses of those of us who saw
    the faults falling under the rubric “neoliberalism” as flowing from the
    logic of capitalism at a certain stage in its development. This did not
    prevent us joining with the wider movement in agitating against those
    faults. As I wrote at the time, “Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of
    people are beginning, for the first time, to challenge the global system.
    They come from a vast range of backgrounds and experiences, and bring with
    them the differing ideas that have developed there”.
    <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> The different approaches were, however,
    bound to work themselves out in practice at some point. I added, “The
    movement will not be able to develop beyond a certain point unless such
    arguments are resolved”. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Developments over the past two years show that the arguments are indeed
    becoming important in practice. Alex Callinicos and Chris Nineham have
    written about the debilitating divisions that emerged in the World Social
    Forum movement that arose out of Seattle <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>,
    while Daniel Bensaïd and Pierre Rousset have pointed out:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    The “pillars” of the alterglobalisation – the Brazilian Workers Party and
    Rifondazione Comunista – lead or actively participate in centre-left
    governments, implementing openly social liberal policies. This evolution in
    less than six years is full of consequences. The problem does not lie in the
    suddenness of the conversions ... The lack of resistance that they have
    encountered within their own parties must focus attention both on the limits
    of the anti-neoliberal rhetoric and the profound resignation that it has
    partially masked. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    For this reason it is necessary to take up once again the analysis of the
    relationship of neoliberalism to capitalism – and by implication, of
    anti-neoliberalism to anti-capitalism. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a

  <h4>Marxist analyses of neoliberalism</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    A number of Marxist analyses have attempted to come to terms with
    neoliberalism, for instance Gerard Duménil and Dominique Lévy’s
    <strong>Capitalism Resurgent</strong>, François Chesnais’s
    <strong>La Mondialisation du Capital</strong> and, probably most
    influentially, David Harvey’s <strong>The New Imperialism</strong> and
    <strong>A Brief History of Neoliberalism</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    These works contain a mass of useful information about the world today. But
    they are also marked by the same ambiguity over neoliberalism to be found in
    the non-Marxist writings within the movement. All make reference to the
    problems faced by capitalism in the 1970s that led to a new period of
    crises. But they suggest that it is not capitalism as such that is to blame;
    rather it is a particular regime of capitalism. So Duménil and Lévy say that
    the new period was heralded by a fall in the rate of profit from which the
    system has not yet fully recovered, <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> but
    then go on to describe the advance of neoliberalism as a “coup” (no less) by
    “finance capital” in the late 1970s. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> This
    coup supposedly overturned the “Keynesian” approach of industrial capital,
    which had been based on accumulation through a “compromise” with working
    class organisations on the terrain of the welfare state.
    <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Chesnais’s tone is often similar. He also refers to a “coup d’etat” in the
    late 1970s. He writes that “industrial capital” has been forced to
    subordinate itself to “money capital”.
    <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> Chesnais is a revolutionary socialist,
    but the implication of his argument is that, if “industrial capital” still
    dominated “finance capital”, capitalism today would not be experiencing a
    “mediocre or poor dynamic of investment” or “the destruction of industrial
    employment ... and strong pressures which weigh on those jobs which remain”.
    <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Essentially the same arguments are to be found in David Harvey’s work. He
    presents a picture of capitalism in the US, Western Europe and Japan before
    the mid-1970s expanding on the basis of “a class compromise between capital
    and labour”. This meant an acceptance that:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    The state could focus on full employment, economic growth and the welfare of
    its citizens, and that state power should be freely deployed alongside of,
    or if necessary, intervening in or substituting for market processes to
    achieve these ends. Fiscal or monetary policies usually dubbed “Keynesian”
    were widely deployed to dampen business cycles and to ensure reasonably full
    employment. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    He calls this “embedded liberalism” and argues that it “delivered high rates
    of economic growth in the advanced capitalist countries in the 1950s and
    1960s” and that a “social and moral economy was fostered through the
    activities of an interventionist state”. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    He recognises that this system broke down in the mid-1970s. This was, he
    argues, caused by “a crisis of over-accumulation”, which he sees as
    persisting into the present. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> But he goes
    on to imply, again and again, that an alternative was possible within the
    existing system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Capitalists, he argues, adopted the neoliberal approach because their class
    power had been diluted under Keynesianism and was threatened in the
    mid-1970s. Their response was determined by their need for a “restoration of
    class power” <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> – or even because
    “neoliberalism creates conditions for class formation”.
    <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    One particular expression of this reassertion of class power has been the
    domination of finance over industry: “There was undoubtedly a power shift
    away from production to the world of finance ... In a conflict between Main
    Street and Wall Street, the latter was to be favoured.” Harvey continues,
    “One substantial core of rising class power under neoliberalism lies,
    therefore, with the CEOs, the key operators on corporate boards, and the
    leaders of the financial, legal and technical apparatuses that surround this
    inner sanctum of capitalist activity.” And while they rise in power, the
    unfortunate shareholders are among those who suffer: “The power of the
    actual owners of capital, the stockholders, has been somewhat diminished”.
    <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    From this it follows not simply that there is an alternative within
    capitalism, but also that this alternative might actually be more favourable
    to capitalism: “Paradoxically, a strong and powerful social democratic and
    working class movement is in a better position to redeem capitalism than is
    capitalist class power.” This, he writes, might “sound a
    counter-revolutionary conclusion” but “it is ordinary people who suffer,
    starve, and even die in the course of capitalist crises rather than the
    upper classes”. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    In <strong>The New Imperialism</strong> Harvey suggests how a reformed
    capitalism might work:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    The United States could downgrade if not turn away from its imperialist
    trajectory by engaging in a massive redistribution of wealth within its
    borders and redirection of capital flows into the production and renewal of
    physical and social infrastructures ... A massive counterattack within the
    US as well as in the other core countries of capitalism against the politics
    of neoliberalism and the cutting of state and social expenditures might be
    one of the only ways to protect capitalism internally from its
    self-destructive and crisis prone tendencies.
    <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    A very similar approach is to be found in Duménil and Lévy, who argue that
    the “Keynesian view of the history of capitalism, including its current
    problems ... is very sensible” and “one can only regret that the political
    conditions of recent decades have not made it possible to stop the
    neoliberal offensive and put to work alternative policies ... in the context
    of other social alliances”. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> The logic of
    this argument is that left wing socialists might be justified in joining
    centre-left governments such as those in Brazil and Italy. Compromising on
    anti-capitalism can, it would seem, permit a challenge to neoliberalism.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>The nature of neoliberalism</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    What is the real character of neoliberalism? The question is not as easy to
    answer as it might seem.
  </p>

  <p>
    At one level neoliberalism is an ideology. Literally “neoliberalism” means
    the “new liberalism”, and “liberalism” in its continental European (as
    opposed to North American) sense means “free market economics”. As such it
    is a resurrection of the orthodox “laissez faire” economic ideology that
    prevailed until the great slump of the 1930s. This ideology contended that
    free market economies will run smoothly, steadily producing more wealth. Any
    problems that arise are supposedly a result of “unnatural monopolies”
    (especially in the labour market), which prevent the free movement of prices
    and wages pulling supply and demand together. State intervention is seen as
    distorting the economy and has to be restricted to defending private
    property, national defence and, in the monetarist version of neoliberalism,
    overseeing the money supply. The ideology is backed by supposed rigorous
    “neoclassical” economic theory, which purports to show mathematically that
    free markets always “clear” – that is, all labour will be employed producing
    goods that are all sold. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Economic “liberalism” of the old sort fell into disrepute as an ideology by
    the end of the Second World War. In fact, it had already begun to be
    superseded as a practice by the beginning of the 20th century, when, as
    Rudolf Hilferding, Nikolai Bukharin and Lenin pointed out, “free market
    capitalism” began to give way to monopoly capitalism and its product,
    imperialism. State intervention was seen as necessary to provide the
    infrastructure for capitalist production (railways had long been
    nationalised in Germany, and in Britain conservative governments
    nationalised the electricity grid and the airlines). The subsequent
    organisation of the national economy for war, first in Germany and Japan,
    then in Britain and the US, showed that state intervention could provide a
    basis for renewed profitability and accumulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was against this background that a new orthodoxy emerged, preaching state
    intervention as the way to protect capitalism against itself. The new
    orthodoxy based itself on the ideas of the British economist John Maynard
    Keynes, who in the 1930s partially revised the neoclassical ideas he had
    previously backed wholeheartedly. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> As Al
    Campbell has noted, after the Second World War “capital adopted Keynesian
    ideas because it believed that the various restric-tions and regulations
    would be beneficial to the process of capital accumulation at that
    historical moment, particularly in comparison with the poor record of
    accumulation presented by its recent experience without those restrictions
    during the Great Depression”. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    There was always some resistance to the new Keynesian orthodoxy. A minority
    of economists, notably Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman, continued to
    hold on to the old doctrine. Campbell claims that “most finance capital
    never accepted the Keynesian compromise”, but that it accounted for only 15
    percent of capital. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> Governments and big
    corporations accepted Keynesian ideology, not because it was imposed upon
    them by working class strength, but because increased economic activity by
    the state was accompanied by much higher levels of profitability in the US
    and major European states than under the pre-war ideology of economic
    liberalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keynesianism as an ideology reflected the reality of capitalism in the
    period after the Second World War. National economies were increasingly
    dominated by near-monopolies that worked with the state to struggle for
    global dominance against near-monopolies based in other national economies.
    The result was a seemingly relentless trend towards increased state
    involvement in capitalist accumulation that had begun in the 1880s. To those
    of us who were taught economics in the early 1960s, Keynesianism was
    <em>the</em> explanation for the sustained economic growth of the post-war
    years. Yet as Robin Matthews pointed out long ago, the economic expansion of
    post-war Britain did not depend on Keynesian “remedies” for recurrent crises
    or on higher levels of government investment than in the pre-war years.
    <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    An important by-product of the statified capitalist economy (and of its arms
    spending in particular) in the industrially advanced countries was full
    employment and therefore a degree of working class strength, which, in the
    late 1950s and 1960s, capital had to make concessions to. But to see these
    concessions as causing the statification or the long boom is to get things
    completely the wrong way round.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keynesianism as an economic practice, rather than an ideology, was not put
    to the test until the first serious economic crisis in 40 years erupted in
    the mid-1970s – and it proved incapable of dealing with it. Capitalists were
    faced with a combination of recession and rising prices known as
    “stagflation”. The Keynesians were at a loss. As one, Francis Cripps, put
    it, they suddenly realised that “nobody really understands how the modern
    economy works. Nobody really knows why we had so much growth in the post-war
    world”. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> Within three or four years
    Keynesianism had been replaced as the orthodoxy by reborn versions of the
    ideas it had pushed aside four decades earlier. This was not a question of
    states somehow coming to accept a wrong set of ideas:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    There was a structural crisis of capitalism. That is, the policies,
    practices and institutions that had been serving well capitalism’s goal of
    capital accumulation ceased to do so. More narrowly, one can say that
    capitalism abandoned the Keynesian compromise in the face of a falling rate
    of profit, under the belief that neoliberalism could improve its profit and
    accumulation performance. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    In its first phase this rebirth of old ideas took the form of “monetarism”.
    Milton Friedman, the central figure in monetarism, claimed that any problems
    with the free market system were caused by governments’ inept control of the
    supply of money. But this version of free market economics proved unworkable
    in less than a decade, and the emphasis shifted to versions like those of
    von Hayek and Robert Lucas, which were even more critical of state
    intervention than Friedman’s. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> The ideas
    were popular with supporters of capitalism for a number of reasons.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>Neoliberalism as a ruling ideology</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    Partly there was simple apologetics. Powerful voices had emerged from the
    popular struggles of the late 1960s and early 1970s challenging the
    legitimacy of capitalism. The mainstream defence against such voices had
    been that Keynesian state intervention had proved capitalism could satisfy
    people’s needs. Now that claim fell apart in the face of economic crisis.
    The argument had to be turned upside down. State intervention was now
    presented as the problem rather than the solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was especially pleasing for those who dealt in finance rather than
    production, because under the new orthodoxy any way of making money was
    necessarily beneficial. Neoliberalism saw sitting at home receiving interest
    or dividend payments as an incentive to production, and therefore a valuable
    social activity. As Nikolai Bukharin had pointed out long before, it was
    “the economic theory of the leisure class”.
    <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    But more than apologetics was involved. There was a sense of desperation
    within capitalist circles in the mid-1970s. The first signs of crisis in
    their system coincided with growing assertiveness among workers. There had
    already been attempts to counter this in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
    Wage controls were imposed in Britain in 1966–70, 1971–2, 1973–4 and 1975–9;
    and in the US in 1971. Left wing supporters of Keynesianism tend to forget
    that these were an integral part of the post-war orthodoxy. But wage
    controls were not effective. They might work for a year or two, but they
    built up resentment among workers, which encouraged militancy even where it
    had hardly existed before, and they eventually fell apart amid waves of
    strikes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reborn free market approaches presented by Friedman and Hayek seemed to
    offer a way out. They claimed that the economy would resolve its own
    problems if it were freed from “distortions” to the market – whether these
    came from state intervention or from trade union interference with the
    “flexibility” of the labour market. Free trade would prevent national
    monopolies distorting prices, and unemployment would settle at the “natural
    rate” necessary to prevent wages eating into profits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ruling class ideologies are rarely just lies cynically spread in order to
    win the acquiescence of the ruled. They are sets of beliefs that give the
    ruling class a sense of its own importance, sanctify its rule in its own
    eyes as well as in the eyes of others and provide it with confidence that it
    can deal with any apparent flaws in its own system. Keynesianism fulfilled
    this role during the post-war decades in the advanced Western countries, as
    did Stalinism in the “Communist” states and “developmentalism” in Latin
    America, as well as the post-colonial states of Africa and Asia. But it
    became increasingly clear from the mid-1970s onwards that state intervention
    could not prevent economic crises in any of the world’s regions.
    <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> Neoliberalism succeeded in filling the
    ideological gap. As such it appealed not just to finance capital, but to
    productive capital as well.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>Neoliberalism in practice</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    It is important to differentiate between the claims of any ideology and what
    those who hold it actually do. There is rarely a direct correlation between
    the two. Yet many commentators, on the right and left alike, continue to
    make claims about neoliberalism that simply do not fit the empirical record
    of the past three decades.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, there is the widespread belief that neoliberalism involves a retreat
    of the state. This is falsified by a glance at the rate of state expenditure
    in the advanced capitalist countries.

  <p class="fst">
    As I have pointed out before in this journal, multinational corporations
    continue to be rooted in states. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> The
    biggest have half their assets, markets and labour forces located in a
    single home state, to which they look to protect their interests. Capitalism
    can no more do without the state today than it could in the Keynesian
    period. State intervention has been used to drive through attacks on
    workers, as with Margaret Thatcher’s anti-union laws or the use of the
    police against the miners’ strike of 1984-5. But it has also repeatedly been
    used to protect sections of capital against the effects of crisis in a way
    supposedly ruled out by neoliberal ideology. The US state helped bail out
    Chrysler when it came close to going bust in 1979; it took charge of
    negotiations in the 1980s to prevent US banks being dragged under by
    unpayable debts from Latin American countries. In 1998 it propped up the
    Long Term Capital Management hedge fund and, most recently, through the
    Federal Reserve central bank, it has tried to limit the damage caused to the
    financial system by the subprime mortgage crisis. Indeed, states have
    intervened more to deal with crises since the 1970s than in the 1960s and
    1950s for the simple reason that the crises have been much more severe.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is true that the inability to stop crises using old “Keynesian”
    techniques has led to short term attempts to leave things to the market in
    the belief that “creative destruction” will allow “efficient” capitals to
    benefit from the weakening or elimination of “inefficient” ones. This is
    what the Volcker shock – the raising of US interest rates at the end of the
    1970s – was supposed to do; it is what the Thatcherites tried to do with
    high interest rates and restriction of the money supply in 1980–4; it was
    also, in effect, what the USSR’s ruling <em>nomenklatura</em> embarked on
    when faced with the great economic, social and political crisis that
    developed from the mid-1980s onwards. But on each occasion those that
    survived these attempts turned back to reliance on the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    The US may be the advanced country where the neoliberal ideology is most
    entrenched. But it has financed government spending by the “Keynesian”
    method of borrowing through most of the neoliberal period in a way that it
    did not do in the Keynesian era. For the US ruling class neoliberalism, in
    the sense of letting the market rip apart established capitals, is something
    to be imposed on weaker national capitalisms to the benefit of US capital,
    not something to be allowed to happen without restriction in the US itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same logic has been followed in Western Europe, Japan, China and, after
    the wave of not very creative destruction under Yeltsin, Russia. By
    contrast, the most thorough attempts to implement neoliberal practices have
    been in the poorer countries of the Global South. Here local ruling classes
    that entrenched their rule during the “developmentalist” post-war years
    embrace genuinely neoliberal measures promoted by the International Monetary
    Fund and World Bank in the hope of becoming junior partners to capitals
    operating from the industrially advanced countries.
    <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> But even in these cases tensions can
    arise, leading to some reassertion of the role of the national state.
    Certain Latin American countries have taken a “neodevelopmentalist” turn –
    complete with Keynesian economic advisers – mixing “Keynesian” and
    “neoliberal” practice in the aftermath of devastating economic, social and
    political crises. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    For these reasons, “neoliberal” is not in reality an accurate description of
    the operation of capital today. We are not faced with a reversion of the
    system to the free market capitalism that came to an end more than a century
    ago. Rather we face a system that attempts to deal with its problems by
    restructuring on an international scale of the units of the system that
    emerged in the course of the 20th century – units that Marxists called
    “monopoly capitalisms”, “state monopoly capitalisms”, or “state
    capitalisms”. States continue to play a central role in trying to facilitate
    or regulate this, even if the internationalisation of production makes this
    much more difficult that in the immediate post-war decades.
  </p>

  <h2>Finance and neoliberalism</h2>

  <p>
    Duménil and Lévy justify their claim that government economic intervention
    in the past three decades has been in the interests of “finance capital” by
    referring to the high long term rates of interest that Paul Volcker imposed
    in 1978, while he was chair of the US Federal Reserve. These high rates
    were, they argue, “maintained through the 1980s and 1990s”.
    <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> This ignores the empirical reality. When
    high interest rates started seriously hurting industry in 1982 Volcker cut
    them, and the real trend of long term interest rates in the second half of
    the neoliberal period has been down, not up.

    The whole claim that there are two distinct sections of capital – finance
    capital and industrial capital – is open to challenge. Many important
    financial institutions not only lend money, but also borrow it, since they
    are involved in “intermediation” between lenders and borrowers. What matters
    for them is not the absolute level of interest rates but the gaps that open
    up between different rates, particularly between long term and short term
    rates. And industrial concerns lend as well as borrow. Typically they
    accumulate surpluses between bouts of new investment, which they lend out in
    return for interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    One important phenomenon over the past quarter of a century has been a long
    term decline in the proportion of surplus value going into new productive
    investment, which is a result of profit rates throughout the system not
    being fully restored to their early 1970s level. Saving by capital is
    greater than productive investment <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a> – and
    industrial capitalists have turned to financial ventures in an attempt to
    use their surpluses profitably. If a greater section of capital is focused
    on finance than in the past, this is not because something called finance
    capital has taken control from industrial capital. It is because industrial
    capital has attempted to restore its profit rates through
    “financialisation”. At the end of the day this is a blind alley for it,
    since only productive labour can produce the new value out of which expanded
    profits can come. It is not that Wall Street has taken over from Main
    Street, as Harvey asserts. It is that both face problems today that they did
    not in the immediate post-war decades.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>Accumulation by dispossession</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    David Harvey’s account of neoliberalism focuses on features that, he claims,
    lead to a new model of capitalist accumulation – accumulation by
    “dispossession”, “primitive accumulation”, and the absorption by capital of
    “non-capitalist” sectors and societies. Accumulation by dispossession is, he
    argues, “the dominant form of accumulating relative to expanded
    reproduction” <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> and takes a wide range of
    forms:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      “The privatisation of land and the forcible movement of peasant
      populations”; “the conversion of ... common, collective, state, etc ...
      property rights ... into exclusive property rights”.<br />
      &nbsp;
    </li>

    <li>
      “The commodification of labour power and the suppression of alternative
      forms of production and consumption”.<br />
      &nbsp;
    </li>

    <li>
      “The monetarisation of exchange and taxation, particularly of land”.<br />
      &nbsp;
    </li>

    <li>
      The reduction of “whole populations to debt peonage”.<br />
      &nbsp;
    </li>

    <li>
      “The dispossession of assets by credit and stock manipulation”.<br />
      &nbsp;
    </li>

    <li>
      “The patenting and licensing of genetic material, seed plasma and all
      manner of products”.<br />
      &nbsp;
    </li>

    <li>
      The “buying up” of assets that have been devalued through crisis “at
      fire-sales prices”, with crises being “orchestrated, managed and
      controlled to rationalise the system” to “permit accumulation by
      dispossession to occur without sparking a general crisis”.<br />
      &nbsp;
    </li>

    <li>
      “The rolling back of regulatory frameworks designed to protect labour”.
      <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fst">
    Harvey’s list includes a range of unpleasant features of contemporary
    capitalism. But merely describing these as “dispossession” does not explain
    the present stage of the system. “Dispossession” is simply a long word
    meaning theft. When Pierre-Joseph Proudhon used the phrase “property is
    theft” in the 19th century, it was an anti-capitalist rallying cry, capable
    of expressing people’s indignation at the system; so too is Harvey’s phrase
    “accumulation by dispossession”. But sloganising against theft is not the
    same as providing a serious analysis, any more than it was when Marx
    criticised Proudhon in 1847.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem with Harvey’s analysis is all the more serious because it
    includes features that have always accompanied capitalist accumulation, like
    the “dispossession” of some capitals by others in the course of the
    recession-boom-recession cycle, as well as attacks on wages and working
    conditions. It also includes methods that some capitalists use to expand
    their profits at the expense of other capitalists such as “the dispossession
    of assets by credit and stock manipulation”. This cannot enable the
    capitalist class as a whole to accumulate more. As Marx put it:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    The class of capitalists taken as a whole cannot enrich itself as a class,
    it cannot increase its total capital, or produce a surplus value, by one
    capitalist’s gaining what another loses. The class as a whole cannot defraud
    itself. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    What applies to the dispossession of some capitalists by others even applies
    to certain forms of dispossession of non-capitalist sectors of the
    population. For instance, the widespread third world phenomenon of forcibly
    driving the urban poor from inner cities to make fortunes for property
    developers involves the further oppression of some of the poorest sections
    of the population. But it does not, in itself, create new value or surplus
    value for the capitalist class as a whole. The rents charged on luxury flats
    or office blocks are paid for out of already existing surplus value in the
    pockets of rich individuals or capitalist corporations.
    <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a><br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>“Primitive” accumulation</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    Harvey argues that dispossession means that “primitive accumulation”, which
    Marx saw as important at the time of the rise of capitalism, continues to be
    a central feature of the world today – indeed, it seems, a more important
    feature than accumulation through the exploitation of labour power. But for
    Marx primitive accumulation was not simply the building up of fortunes by
    early capitalists through robbery. It was, centrally, robbery of land from
    peasants, which then forced them to seek employment as wage workers. Its
    specificity did not lie in exploiting classes increasing their wealth by
    force (something that has happened in all sorts of class societies).
    Crucially, it permitted the development of a specifically capitalist way of
    expanding this wealth by creating a class of “free” workers with no choice
    but to sell their labour power to those now in control of the means of
    production.
  </p>

  <p>
    This form of “primitive” accumulation does continue today. Old landowners in
    Egypt, agrarian capitalists in Brazil, local Communist Party bosses in China
    and recently established capitalist farmers in India are continually trying
    to grab the land of local peasants, and where they succeed a new proletariat
    is created. But Harvey is mistaken in claiming this only characterises
    recent decades. As Terry Byres has noted, primitive accumulation occurred in
    the colonial empires that persisted into the post-war decades, although it
    was “far less successful in its separation of the producers from the means
    of production than domestic primitive accumulation was in Western Europe ...
    it had also left a large stratum of poor peasants in possession of land”.
    <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    While recent decades have seen the crudest forms of primitive accumulation,
    “it is not obvious that capitalist transformation is proceeding
    successfully” except in the case of East Asia.
    <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> For Byres, the only large country where
    primitive accumulation has added substantially to capital accumulation as
    such is China, where “from 1978 onwards, millions were driven off the land,
    i.e. were effectively dispossessed and proletarianised”.
    <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    No account of primitive accumulation should leave out the most important in
    the 20th century – the seizure of the land from the USSR’s tens of millions
    of peasant families through Stalin’s “collectivisation” of agriculture from
    1929 onwards. Harvey refers to this, but cannot include it in his account of
    the pre-neoliberal capitalist era, since he sees Stalinist-type regimes as
    attempts “to implement programmes of modernisation in those countries that
    have not gone through the initiation into capitalist development”.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Harvey, Marx’s account of “primitive accumulation” is less important
    than an idea drawn from Rosa Luxemburg. She argued that a shortage of demand
    for capitalism’s products meant the system could only continue to expand by
    cannibalising the pre-capitalist world around it. Harvey writes, “The idea
    that some sort of ‘outside’ is necessary for the stabilisation of capitalism
    ... has relevance.” He argues that capitalism’s problem is
    “over-accumulation” and that this can be solved by eating up “non-capitalist
    social formations or some sector within capitalism that has not yet been
    proletarianised”. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    But what is there “outside capitalism” to allow “accumulation by
    dispossession” on the necessary scale? Harvey’s answer is that the state
    constitutes this “outside” – whether it is the state of the so-called
    “non-capitalist countries”, the developmental state in much of the Third
    World, or the state sector in advanced capitalist countries. Since these are
    all, for him, non-capitalist, a shift of their resources into private hands
    can provide new resources for capitalist accumulation. In making this
    argument, Harvey chimes with the “common sense” of a good portion of the
    left internationally, but it is a mistaken common sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Already in the 1870s Engels understood that nationalisation does not in
    itself produce something outside capitalism:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist
    machine, the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the
    total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of
    productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist,
    the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage workers –
    proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is rather
    brought to a head. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    In the period following the Second World War all serious Marxist analyses
    had to take into account intervention by states, not only to support private
    capitalists, but also to undertake capital accumulation in their own right.
    For instance, the German Marxist Joachim Hirsch described how:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    As the development of the productive forces progresses, the maintenance of
    the process of accumulation demands, on the one hand, forms and individual
    capitals of an order of magnitude which capital, to some extent, is no
    longer capable of bringing forth itself directly in its reproduction
    process, and which can only be realised through the intervention of the
    state apparatus. On the other hand, this very process creates the necessity
    for counteracting state interventions to guarantee a relative equilibrium in
    the process of reproduction as a whole. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    To read Harvey, you would think that the existence of a substantial state
    sector slowed down accumulation during the post-war decades. But that was a
    time with a higher rate of accumulation than today, so much so that is has
    been baptised “the golden age of capitalism”. As Ben Fine notes, “The boom
    ... was sustained by the opposite of the factors that Harvey now takes to be
    instrumental in current accumulation, not least the extension of
    nationalised industries and the economic role of the state more generally”.
    <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a><br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>The real rationale for privatisation</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    There has been a trend towards privatisation of nationalised industries
    across much of the capitalist world for the past quarter of a century, just
    as there was a trend in the opposite direction through much of the 20th
    century. How are we to explain this? A number of distinct factors are
    involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first moves to privatise state owned industries in the 1980s were often
    a pragmatic response to “the fiscal crisis of the state” – the pressure on
    government finances as recession cut into tax revenues, and unemployment
    forced up dole and social security payments. Selling off state holdings in
    profitable companies, and then whole state owned corporations, brought in
    lots of cash and provided short term relief for governments’ problems. It
    was this that motivated the 1974-9 Labour government to sell shares in Burma
    Oil and BP.
  </p>

  <p>
    Combined with this was a belief that state monopolies, removed from the
    pressure of competition, were not pushing their workers hard enough. This
    ties in with a wider notion that is often repeated today, even by some on
    the left – that the period of state economic interventionism was somehow
    based on a “Fordist” compromise between employers and workers (a view which
    should be refuted by the actual behaviour of the Ford Motor Company).
    <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> The logic of this view was that breaking
    up state owned monopolies and opening them to the market would force their
    managers to be much harder on the workers, and would intimidate the workers
    into accepting worse conditions. Certainly the approach of privatisation
    often encouraged managers to force through methods to push up productivity.
    And once privatised, it was easy for companies to “contract out” a range of
    activities, so breaking the links that tie weak groups of workers to
    potentially more powerful ones. Ben Fine argues that “privatisation has been
    an important way in which the relations between capital and labour have been
    reorganised” and is connected to so-called “labour market flexibility”.
    <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    But this motivation for privatisation could clash with its use as a short
    term solution to the state’s financial problems. For the state to make a lot
    of money out of privatisation, the privatisers had to have a prospect of
    monopoly profits. The breaking up of firms to shake up managers and frighten
    workers would do away with the monopoly. In practice most firms were sold
    intact, and left in a position of being able to charge monopoly prices to
    other sections of capital. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a> The state then
    had to appoint “regulators” to try to do by decree what the market was meant
    to do.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, privatisation is not absolutely necessary to create the
    illusion of the automatism of the market. The breaking up of state run
    institutions into competing units (NHS trusts, foundation hospitals, city
    academies, “self-governing” colleges, “agencies”) can try to achieve the
    same goal; so can “market testing” within particular entities. So too can
    deregulation aimed to produce competition between different nationally
    based, and often still state owned, companies. This is what the European
    Union is trying to do to a whole range of industries such as electricity and
    postal services. The end result of privatisation in a country like Britain
    can be that whole sections of “privatised” services such as electricity,
    water and rail can be run by foreign state owned companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    These last examples refute Harvey’s portrayal of privatisation somehow
    crossing a magic line from “non-capitalist” to “capitalist” production. They
    do fit in with his description of neoliberalism as concerned with “class
    power”, although describing this as a “restoration”, let alone a creation,
    of class power is to massively exaggerate the weakness of the capitalist
    class in the pre-neoliberal period. There is also considerable debate about
    how effective privatisation has really been. Keynesian pro-capitalist
    analysts have produced studies suggesting zero or very few gains to
    “efficiency” from privatisation compared to changes such as new technology
    that could have been introduced just as effectively, perhaps even more
    effectively, in a nationalised concern.
  </p>

  <p>
    Class power is involved in privatisation in another way. A powerful
    ideological myth sustaining capitalist rule within bourgeois democracies is
    that the state represents the whole of the population. To sustain this myth
    the ruling class has to concede a margin of influence to the mass of people
    over the behaviour of the state through elections. This was not a problem
    when the general level of profitability allowed it to grant real reforms.
    Indeed, state possession of industries could help sustain the myth that the
    state was neutral in relation to class forces, so stabilising capitalism
    politically as well as economically. But when capitalism entered a long
    period of crises three decades ago a risk arose that people would expect the
    state controlled section of industry to protect them against the impact of
    these crises. Separating industry off from the state and subjecting it to
    the market can depoliticise the attacks on workers that accompany the
    crisis, shifting the blame to the seemingly automatic, natural forces of the
    market.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Gavriil Popov, the free market economist who was mayor of Moscow during
    the tumultuous years 1989 to 1992, argued:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    If we cannot soon denationalise and privatise property, we will be attacked
    by waves of workers fighting for their own interests. This will break up the
    forces of perestroika and put its future in question ... We must seek new
    mechanisms and institutions of political power that depend less on populism.
    <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    This Russian example challenges Harvey’s ideas that “non-capitalist states”
    were transformed into capitalist ones to the benefit of the world system as
    a whole between 1989 and 1991. Far from this seeing the “creation” of a new
    class, many of the same people continued to control industry and the state.
    Faced with a great social crisis, they sought to find a way out by
    restructuring the economy under their control, and to protect themselves,
    through forms of privatisation giving the impression of ownership by the
    mass of people (for instance, privatisation by distributing vouchers, which
    favoured industrialists and apparatchiks who could then buy them up on the
    cheap). Some of the old ruling class gained from this and some lost out. But
    it can hardly be argued that the result was a great boost to accumulation
    either in the former USSR or worldwide – accumulation rates worldwide fell
    in the 1990s to even lower levels than in the 1980s.
    <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The almost “giveaway” privatisations of 1980s Britain, when firms and
    housing stock were sold below their real value, had the additional
    ideological advantage of winning support from sections of the middle class
    and some workers. However, this was not nearly as powerful a force as those
    who talked in the mid-1980s about “authoritarian populism” used to claim.
    For instance, one 1980s study found that workers who bought their council
    houses were no more likely to vote Tory than those who had not.
    <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a> Harvey overstates the case when he writes
    that under Thatcher “middle class values spread more widely to encompass
    many of those who had once had a firm working class identity”.
    <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two more factors involved in the trend towards privatisation. Many
    commentators hold that it makes restructuring through mergers and
    acquisitions across national boundaries easier. As Ben Fine has argued,
    restructuring internationally “has posed a problem to state owned industries
    which are confined to domestic ownership alone”.
    <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a> For capitalists involved in such
    activities, there is always the suspicion that a state owned partner will be
    getting tax concessions and subsidies from its government which will distort
    its balance sheets – and that if the merged company faces economic
    difficulties that government will come under political pressure to try to
    pass the buck to the foreign partner.
  </p>

  <p>
    This element in the logic of privatisation is particularly appealing to
    those best placed to gain from it. Privatisation imposed on Third World
    countries by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as the price
    of deferring debt repayments can be of considerable benefit to American and
    European capital. Harvey quite rightly makes this point. He is, however,
    mistaken when he gives the impression that this form of “accumulation by
    dispossession” is somehow central to profit making.
  </p>

  <p>
    An indication of where capital can best gain profits is given by the global
    flows of foreign direct investment. Two thirds of these are to the advanced
    countries, and the biggest chunk of the rest is to one destination only –
    China. The fact that those non-Western countries with financial surpluses
    (China, the Gulf oil states, etc.) have been using them to finance “private
    equity” takeovers of Western firms suggests that they know where most of the
    lucre still lies. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, privatisation is very profitable for some capitalists. It cannot in
    itself create more surplus value. Only increasing the exploitation of
    workers or peasants can do that. Otherwise all that is involved is diverting
    surplus value from one capitalist to another. But it does benefit particular
    capitalists. Their material interests are very much connected with the
    propagation of neoliberal ideology, and they set out to woo, bribe and
    browbeat politicians into pushing privatisation further.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>How effective is neoliberalism for capitalism?</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    There is always a certain danger in propagandising and agitating against
    repeated capitalist offensives. In stressing the harm they do it is very
    easy to overestimate their success and to underestimate the obstacles
    confronting them. It is also easy to forget that these obstacles come not
    only from popular resistance, but from contradictions within capitalism
    itself. A picture is presented of a defeated working class, no longer
    capable of withstanding the onslaught on its conditions. The typical worker
    is said to suffer precarious employment, with the threat continually hanging
    over his or her head of the firm simply shutting down and moving abroad.
  </p>

  <p>
    So John Holloway asserts, “Capital can move from one side of the world to
    the other within seconds”. <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a> Hardt and
    Negri’s <strong>Empire</strong> claims, “Capital can withdraw from
    negotiation with a given local population by moving its site to another
    point in the global network ... Entire labouring populations have thus found
    themselves in increasingly precarious employment situations”.
    <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a> For Harvey, capital relocates production
    as one of the “spatial temporal fixes” through which it responds to
    over-accumulation: “The geographical mobility of capital permits it to
    dominate a global labour force whose own geographical mobility is
    constrained”. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a> With technological change
    “offshore produc-tion became possible and the search for profit made it
    probable. Wave after wave of deindustrialisation hit industry after industry
    and region after region within the US”.
    <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a> This, he claims, enables capital to
    impose increasingly precarious forms of work on workers:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    In the neoliberal scheme of things short term contracts are preferred in
    order to maximise flexibility ... Flexible labour markets are established
    ... The individualised and relatively powerless worker then confronts a
    labour market in which only short term contracts are offered on a customised
    basis. Security of tenure becomes a thing of the past. Under
    neoliberalisation, the figure of “the disposable worker” emerges as
    prototypical upon the world stage ... Disposable workers – women in
    particular – survive both socially and affectively in a world of flexible
    labour markets and short term contracts, chronic job insecurities, lost
    social protections, and often debilitating labour, amongst the wreckage of
    collective institutions that once gave them a modicum of dignity and
    support. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    This picture is not unique to left critics of neoliberalism. It is also to
    be found in the writings of those who have abandoned the left to embrace
    some version of the “Third Way”. Some of the phrases in Harvey could almost
    come from the writings of Anthony Giddens or Manuel Castells.
    <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a> Castells, for instance, writes of:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    Structural unstability [<em>sic</em>] in the labour markets everywhere, and
    the requirement for flexibility of employment, mobility of labour, and
    constant reskilling of the workforce. The notion of the stable, predictable,
    professional career is eroded, as relationships between capital and labour
    are individualised and contractual labour conditions escape collective
    bargaining. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    So many different voices tell the story that, it seems, no amount of
    counter-evidence can stop people believing in it.
    <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a> For instance, Harvey, writing 18 years
    ago, admitted that such counter-evidence exists, referring to the empirical
    work of Anna Pollert who “challenges the ideas of flexibility in labour
    markets and labour organisation and concludes the ‘discovery of the flexible
    workforces is part of an ideological offensive which celebrates pliability
    and casualisation and makes them seem inevitable’”.
    <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a> His response was simply to dismiss such
    evidence out of hand: “I do not accept this position. The evidence for
    increased flexibility (subcontracting, temporary and self employment, etc)
    through the capitalist world is simply too overwhelming to make Pollert’s
    counter-examples credible”. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a> He did not
    himself provide such evidence, and does not in his later books either.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have challenged the sorts of claims Harvey takes for granted before and do
    not intend to lay out the evidence once more here.
    <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a> But certain important points need to be
    made:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Financial capital may be very mobile, but industrial capital is fixed in
      buildings, machinery and a material infrastructure required to sustain it.
      It cannot move at a moment’s notice. Harvey at least recognises that
      <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a>, but does not let it ruin his story of
      the relentless spread of precariousness.
    </li>

    <li>
      The major source of recent job losses has not been the contracting out of
      work abroad. Tim Koechlin has analysed US investment and concludes that
      between 1991 and 2004 foreign direct investment by US companies only
      amounted to 7.4 percent of total productive investment by those companies,
      and investment in “developing countries” to only 2.5 percent.
      <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a> Another study shows that between 1993
      and 1998 US manufacturing employment “increased from 16.8 to 17.6 million
      and almost regained the 1989 peak of 18 million”. This was followed by
      “the largest slump in manufacturing employment in post-war history”. This
      was not caused by a flood of imports of either goods or services, but
      rather “the result of inadequate growth of domestic demand in the presence
      of strong productivity growth” and the “weakness of US exports” due to
      “the high US dollar”. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      Capital cannot manage without workers who have certain skills, and prefers
      workers who have some sense of responsibility for the job. It takes
      employers time to train people and they are rarely keen to lose them if
      they can avoid it. They therefore do not always treat workers as
      “disposable”, even when it comes to semi-skilled and unskilled labour.
      This is true just as much in less developed countries as in the advanced
      industrial ones. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      The empirical evidence for Western Europe does not justify a picture of a
      uniform, relentless spread of precarious jobs. There was a “substantial”
      increase in the number of such jobs in the early 1990s, but the relative
      proportions of permanent jobs (82 percent) and non-permanent jobs (18
      percent) remained almost unchanged between 1995 and 2000. There are also
      huge variations between countries. Despite Britain being supposedly the
      most neoliberal country in Europe, one measure of precarious employment
      shows it as amounting to only 16 percent of jobs in 1992 as compared to 35
      percent in Spain. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> There was actually a
      decline in the course of the 1990s, so that by 2000 one survey showed only
      5 percent of British employees being on temporary contracts.
      <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> And the number of people who had worked
      at the same workplace for more than ten years rose from 29 to 31 percent.
      <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      Many forms of work lumped together as “precarious” are long term,
      permanent jobs. This is true of the great majority of part time jobs,
      which are by no means temporary. This is also true of many jobs with short
      term contracts. Often short term contracts are for workers who are in fact
      permanent, with their contracts regularly being renewed when they expire.
      They are denied certain employment rights, but that does not mean the
      employer can easily dispense with their services or prevent them having
      the power to fight back. After all, there were no such things as formal
      contracts of employment in Britain before the introduction of redundancy
      payments in the late 1960s, and employers had the right to sack workers
      whenever they felt like it. But this did not prevent the growth of
      shopfloor based union strength, even among groups such as dockers who were
      employed on a daily basis.
    </li>

    <li>
      Often what is involved is not workers losing the capacity to exert
      leverage on employers, but employers seeking to undermine workers’ belief
      that they can do so. A study by Kate Bronfenbrenner found that during the
      economic upturn of the 1990s American workers felt more insecure about
      their economic future than during the depths of the 1990–1 recession.
      “More than half of all employers made threats to close all or part of the
      plant” during union organising drives. But afterwards “employers followed
      through on the threat and shut down all or part of their facilities in
      fewer than 3 percent” of cases. <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fst">
    In other words, it is in the interests of employers to overemphasise how
    precarious jobs are in order to demoralise workers and lower the level of
    resistance. The task of the left is not to exaggerate insecurity, but to
    point to the counter-factors that provide workers with continued strength if
    they have the confidence to deploy it.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>Neoliberalism, the welfare state and the social wage</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    There is an assumption in most anti-neoliberal writing that we are living
    through a period of the “withdrawal of state from social provision”, as
    Harvey puts it. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a> But once again empirical
    evidence does not back up such assertions, particularly for the advanced
    industrial countries. State expenditure on social provision, like state
    expenditure in general, has, if anything, tended to rise through the decades
    since the 1970s (see figure 4).
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 1995 expenditure on “social protection” by the main European countries
    has been more or less fixed, going up and down slightly with unemployment
    levels, and was no lower in the most recent US recessions than previous
    ones, despite “welfare reform” in the Clinton presidency. An analysis by
    Anwar Shaikh calculated the “net social wage” – the value of social
    expenditure from which workers benefit minus the taxes which workers pay –
    in a number of countries. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a> He found that,
    for Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Sweden combined, this
    net social wage was generally higher as a proportion of GNP in the 1980s
    than in the 1960s and 1970s; the trend was similar in the US (figure 5).

  <p class="fst">
    Shaikh’s analysis also makes a very important point. The bulk of “social
    wage” expenditure has always been paid for out of taxes on ordinary wages.
    In effect, it amounts to a redistribution of wage income within the working
    class – and in the US in the 1950s and 1960s, when the net social wage was
    negative, it amounted to workers providing a subsidy to the state rather
    than vice versa. Noting the variation between countries he writes:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    Unlike the United States, the other OECD countries had generally positive
    net social wage ratios. Germany and the United Kingdom had the highest
    ratios, though even they averaged only about 5 percent of GDP and about 8
    percent of total wages. Second, Sweden, the very paradigm of a welfare
    state, had an average net social wage around zero over the boom period.
    <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    There have been repeated attempts by governments to cut back on social
    expenditures over the past three decades. Indeed in Britain struggles
    against cutbacks began much earlier than that.
    <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a> Yet the expenditures have gone on rising.
    How is that to be explained?
  </p>

  <p>
    Part of the explanation has to do with struggles against the cutbacks. So
    long as governments depend on elections in bourgeois democracies, they
    cannot completely ignore the impact of their policies on the lives of the
    mass of the population. So in Britain the prominence of the NHS in
    successive general elections led New Labour to increase the proportion of
    GNP going into it. Harvey is right to highlight “the balance of class
    forces” in determining the degree of neoliberalisation.
    <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a> But that is not the end of the story.
    There are features built into capitalism that compel it to pay out a social
    wage even though it resents doing so.
  </p>

  <p>
    Capitalist ruling classes can only prosper by exploiting people’s capacity
    to work (their “labour power”). That capacity is damaged by illness,
    accidents and malnutrition. So capitalists have to worry about keeping a fit
    and able body of workers (i.e. “reproducing labour power”). That requires
    healthcare for workers, and benefits to enable workers to survive through
    periods of unemployment so that they can be fit for exploitation when the
    economy revives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern capitalism also has to worry about the upbringing of the next
    generation of labour power, and ensuring it has the right level of
    education, training and work discipline to be profitably exploited. Hence
    the way its apologists worry about the “human capital” of the workforce and
    the amount of educational “value added” by schools. Finally, it is not just
    a question of physical wellbeing and aptitude. It is also a question of
    morale. The capitalist wants contented workers to exploit in the same way
    that a farmer wants contented cows. Workers cannot be expected to labour
    with any commitment to their work if they expect to starve to death once
    they reach retirement age. As Marx put it, there is a historically and
    socially determined element to the cost of reproducing labour power as well
    as a physiological one.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pivotal moment in welfare development in Britain was the panic that
    developed at the time of the Boer War, when it was discovered that a high
    proportion of those who tried to enlist in the armed forces were not fit
    enough to fight. Ann Rogers has summarised the upper and middle class
    reaction:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    The belief that change was necessary if Britain was to compete successfully
    with Germany and the United States remained central. Whether the argument
    was formulated by the Fabians or by Liberal imperialists the concentration
    was on the damage that poverty was doing to society rather than the misery
    it caused individual workers ... the underlying reason for the desire to
    improve the health of the working class was the need for a healthier labour
    force in the factories and the army. <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    This was the background to the granting of old age pensions and the
    provision of school meals by the Liberal government of 1906.
  </p>

  <p>
    But labour power is not an object like other commodities, which are passive
    as they are bought and sold. It is the living expression of human beings.
    What from a capitalist point of view is “recuperation of labour power” is
    for the worker the chance for relaxation, enjoyment and creativity. There is
    a struggle over the social wage just as over the normal wage, even if both
    are, up to a certain degree, necessary for capital.
  </p>

  <p>
    This makes it very difficult for capital to redesign the welfare state in a
    way which would really fit with its narrow economic requirements. That would
    involve maintaining and even expanding those of its elements that are
    essential to the maintenance and reproduction of a productive labour force,
    while curtailing or abandoning “non-productive” expenditure on things like
    the care of the chronic sick, of the seriously disabled and of retired
    workers. The competitive extraction of surplus value demands the
    continuation of part of the welfare state. The political realities of
    maintaining power through bourgeois democracy rule out dismantling the rest
    of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where internal markets, market testing, contracting out,
    privatisation, encouraging private pensions and all the rest come in. They
    are mechanisms that are meant to depoliticise the process of social
    provision, so making it easier to refuse it to those deemed not to deserve
    it on the one hand, and to clamp down on the workers in the welfare sector
    on the other.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  <h4>The political ambiguities of anti-neoliberalism</h4>

  <p class="fst">
    Why do these arguments matter if we are all agreed that marketisation,
    privatisation and precariousness are bad things? They matter because
    mis-analysis leads to serious mistakes when it comes to fighting back. If
    the centre of accumulation has moved from day to day exploitation to
    “dispossession”, then the focus of the fight shifts from the working class
    to struggles of those who are marginal to the productive process. The shift
    in focus is further reinforced if almost all jobs are seen as precarious,
    with employers being able to dismiss any workers who rebel. This is what
    Harvey seems to be arguing when he writes that in the post-1973 world
    “accumulation by dispossession moved to the fore as the primary
    contradiction within the imperialist organisation of capital accumulation”.
    <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Such an analysis puts a stress on “social movements” as opposed to class
    movements. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a> The writers who have gone
    furthest in drawing such a conclusion are Laclau and Mouffe who write that
    the “overdetermination assumed by social struggles in the third world”
    involves “the construction of political identities having little to do with
    strict class boundaries”. <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a> Harvey resists
    this conclusion, at points insisting that class is central to resistance,
    but his theoretical framework leaves it open to an interpretation little
    different from that of Laclau and Mouffe. This has important practical
    implications. Struggles of social movements tend to rise rapidly and then
    fall back just as rapidly precisely because they are not based on those
    whose position within the structures of capitalist production binds them
    together organically and provides them with the power to confront the
    system. As the saying goes, social movements “rise like a rocket and fall
    like a stick”. What are left behind are skeleton organisations that are too
    weak to achieve their goals. Those involved are then all too easily tempted
    to conclude that a struggle cannot lead to victory, and to put their faith
    in reforms within the existing society, whether through old style reformist
    and populist parties or through NGOs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instructive in this regard are the arguments used by Fausto Bertinotti of
    Rifondazione Comunista in Italy to justify his turn to a government
    coalition with the pro-capitalist “centre-left” led by Romano Prodi. His
    turn came as the wave of demonstrations that occurred between the Genoa G8
    protest (July 2001) and the start of the Iraq war (March 2003) began to
    decline, and in the wake of the failure to gain enough votes in a referendum
    on workers’ rights for it to pass into law. He painted a picture of the
    popular movements in Italy risking devastating defeats because
    precariousness had sapped people’s capacity to fight back:
  </p>

  <p class="quoteb">
    The basic thing that characterises neoliberal globalisation is
    precariousness. It conditions the time devoted to labour and life, the
    relations of production and social relations, and which even penetrates into
    attempts to modify the people’s lives. <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a>
  </p>

  <p class="fst">
    What was involved in Rifondazione’s shift was not just the capitulation – or
    betrayal – of one individual. Crucial was his capacity to convince many
    thousands of activists to accept his arguments. This was possible because
    Rifondazione’s activists had long been influenced by certain autonomist and
    Eurocommunist ideas that held that the working class’s strength had been
    damaged permanently by the mobility of capitalism and the
    “deindustrialisation” and “precarity” it produced. Social movements were
    seen as the only way forward, and when they went into decline the only hope
    seemed to be entering a government which might make at least a little turn
    away from “neoliberalism”. Much the same happened to some of the
    semi-autonomist left in Argentina after the great revolt of December 2001 to
    January 2002. Once the great upsurge of the social movements of
    <em>piqueteros</em> and the popular assemblies died down, the easy option
    seemed to be to work with the Kirchner government as it made its turn away
    from the radical version of neoliberalism of the previous decade.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such shifts, from radical opposition to working through parties and
    governments that try to manage the system for capitalism, are encouraged by
    the notions of a “good” “Keynesian” version of capitalism and a “bad”
    “neoliberal” one – or the parallel contrast between “finance capital” that
    does not care for workers and “productive capital” that supposedly does. The
    reality is that capital uses the state as much today as it did in the heyday
    of “Keynesianism” – indeed, even more so, insofar as it is faced with more
    crises needing intervention. Neoliberalism as an ideology does not guide
    practice when it comes to this matter. The difference with the post-war
    decades is that capital is anxious to cut back on many of the positive
    reforms it granted in a more profitable era, and states respond accordingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is this which leads to the ambiguities in the use of the term
    “neoliberalism” by the left. The term can be used simply to designate the
    negative features of many governmental measures in the present phase of the
    system – the anti-reforms that have replaced the positive reforms it was
    possible to extract from capital without a great deal of struggle from the
    late 1940s to the mid-1970s. But the term can also be used to reinforce the
    illusion that minor changes in the running of parts of the system are all
    that is necessary to improve the situation of the mass of people. By the
    same token, those who see their fight as an “anti-neoliberal” one can move
    on to see it as “anti-capitalist”, but they can also slip back into
    conciliation with the system. Rhetoric and slogans have a role in politics,
    but they are not a substitute for clarity about the enemy and how to fight
    it. And we will all need more clarity as the competitive pressures on
    national states and capitalist firms in a period of recurrent crises leads
    to more attacks on the wage, the social wage, working conditions and jobs.

  <p class="note">
    <a href="#f19" name="n19">19.</a> Harvey’s account is based on a passage in
    the third volume of Marx’s <strong>Capital</strong>. But, for Marx,
    over-accumulation occurs at one phase of the slump-boom cycle. When the boom
    reaches its height, capital accumulation exceeds the resources of labour
    power needed to sustain it by providing surplus value to maintain the rate
    of profit. This leads to the production of more commodities than the system
    can absorb. In Marx’s account the resulting crisis removes
    over-accumulation. For Harvey overproduction seems to be a permanent
    condition, but he does not explain how this is possible. To do so he would
    have to examine the nature of the capitalist cycle today and its impact on
    the rate of profit.

    “fixes” is investment in long term infrastructure projects within
    capitalism. It is these that he sees as absorbing “excess” capital and
    labour during the early post-war decades, although without explaining how
    they maintained the profitability of capital. His argument in some ways
    resembles that of Baran and Sweezy in <strong>Monopoly Capital</strong> –
    but unlike them Harvey hardly mentions the huge sums spent on arms in
    <strong>A Short History of Neoliberalism</strong>,
    <strong>The New Imperialism</strong> or his earlier
    <strong>The Condition of Postmodernity</strong>. It is this omission that
    allows him to conceive of a peaceful “spatial fix” for capitalism today. For
    an acute criticism of his argument, see Fine, 2006, pp.&nbsp;143–144.

  <p class="note">
    <a href="#f61" name="n61">61.</a> Duménil and Lévy have completely distorted
    the picture in one of their widely read articles. They assert that “in 2000,
    US financial investments (treasury bills, bonds, commercial paper, stock
    shares, direct investment, etc.) in the rest of the world amounted to 3,488
    billion dollars. The corresponding income was 381 billion dollars, that is,
    a return of nearly 11 percent. It is interesting to note that this income
    was approximately equal to the total after-tax profits of all corporations
    in the United States, excluding such flows from abroad – that is a ratio of
    100 percent” (Duménil and Lévy, 2004b). This is a complete misuse of
    figures, since it ignores foreign investments in the US and the counterflow
    of income from the US to capitalists and states abroad. Inward investment
    into the US has for some years been considerably greater than outward
    investment from it – even if the outward investment is on average more
    profitable. Duménil and Lévy recognise this elsewhere, giving figures
    showing income flows into and out of the US balancing each other. See the
    graph reproduced in Harvey, 2005, p.&nbsp;191.
