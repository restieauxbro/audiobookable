      “White freedom”. “Black betrayal”. “Stay in your lane”. To be antiracist
      in the twenty-first century is to view political values in racial terms;
      to insist that if one is reactionary, one has lost the privilege of being
      black; to erect racial boundaries beyond which certain people should not
      step. Where once anti-racists might have seen these as prescriptions to
      challenge, now they are regarded as edicts to embrace. And where once
      antiracists saw their mission as combating racism, now many see it as
      confronting whiteness. (p.236)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    In <em>Not So Black and White</em>, Kenan Malik puts forward a radical
    challenge to the identity politics that dominates the left and asks how such
    a defeatist and dangerous worldview arose. In doing so he explores the roots
    of race as a category and the purpose for which it was developed. Malik
    shows that race is a decidedly modern concept. He also shows that far from
    being a politics rooted in left-wing traditions, identity politics has its
    origins in the construction of race as a category itself, that is, it
    actually has its theoretical origins in the racist right.
  </p>
  <p>
    Malik instead wants progressive, anti-racist politics to revive the approach
    he believes typifies the radical Enlightenment period – universalism. This
    is the idea that all people share a common humanity, that people are born
    equal, and that they should have equal rights.

  <p>
    Malik’s book is a genuinely exciting and stimulating work, one that hums
    with rage at the injustice of our modern society. He wants to revive the
    traditions of working-class militancy and solidarity to overcome this. There
    are limitations to the book; importantly it lacks a discussion of what
    social transformation will be needed to overcome racism and oppression, and
    has an almost uncritical analysis of radical liberalism. Despite these
    deficiencies, Malik’s book is still a valuable read for radicals who want to
    understand why racism persists today, and for the discussion of identity
    politics.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are four narratives running through <em>Not So Black and White</em>.
    First, there is a retelling of the story of race (p.4.). Second, Malik
    points to the powerful resistance movements against racism and colonialism
    and shows how this resistance expanded the meaning of universality and
    inequality. The third narrative is the relationship between race and class,
    where Malik rightly argues that issues that seem straightforwardly about
    race can sometimes be best understood through the prism of class, and that
    “our preoccupation with race frequently hides the realities of injustice”
    (p.6). The final narrative of the book seeks to explain the emergence of
    modern identity politics.
  </p>
  <h2>The retelling of race</h2>
  <p>
    The most common understanding of racism relies on a conservative
    understanding of human nature, whereby humans are innately scared of “the
    other”. According to this theory, we fear people who look different from us
    and therefore engage in racist behaviours based on more or less conscious
    racist ideas. This supposedly explains the full spectrum of racist
    behaviour: from derogatory language and exclusion of racially different
    people from certain spaces, right up to violent attacks, police killings and
    war. There also is a widespread acceptance of the idea that race is
    something fixed and timeless, and this is linked to people’s acceptance of
    racism as inevitable. In this view, the concept of race itself is never
    really challenged. In fact, it is largely assumed from the outset: “certain
    people are treated unequally because they belong to, or are seen as
    belonging to, a distinct race” (p.12). Malik helpfully points out that “the
    trouble with this argument is that race, like equality, is a social not a
    natural concept. It, too, had to be ‘invented’” (p.12). Malik’s book is an
    attempt to overturn all of these ideas, and discusses how they developed
    alongside modern capitalism. As part of this, he largely recapitulates the
    Marxist argument about the capitalist roots of modern racism, particularly
    in the slave trade.
  </p>
  <p>
    As capitalism started to spread across the globe, it required vast swathes
    of territory and people in order to expand. That meant invasions,
    occupations and the stealing of people for slave industries. At the same
    time, the development of capitalism also meant the development of new ideas
    and ways of thinking. The bourgeois revolutions, aside from bringing a new
    ruling class to power, also created a revolutionary way of thinking about
    the world. Instead of there being a divine order, in which the king was the
    earthly representation of God and every man (and woman) had their position
    and station in life, we instead had “equality, liberty, fraternity”; the
    idea being that all men (for most Enlightenment thinkers, this did not
    include women) were equal.
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve this contradiction between a system reliant on slavery and
    colonialism and the progressive republican ideal, race, racial categories
    and racism were developed. Where previously slaves from Africa and
    indentured servants from Ireland were often treated similarly, now a
    racialised hierarchy and set of laws and institutions had to be formed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the excellent chapter “The Invention of White Identity”, Malik takes the
    reader through a history of the development of these new racial hierarchies.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Transatlantic slavery did not develop for racial reasons. European elites
      would have developed a slave system utilizing poor whites had it been
      practically possible. Attitudes to black slaves and white servants were,
      in the seventeenth century, similar. Over time, though, slavery became
      racialized. Partly, this was for pragmatic reasons – slaves were cheaper
      and easier to control. Partly, also, there developed deeper, more
      ideological motives. It was necessary to justify the acceptance of
      servitude in a society that proclaimed its fidelity to freedom and
      liberty. The racialization of slavery became a means of doing so. (p.70)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Malik sheds light on the faux science of race – including eugenics,
    phrenology, discussions of blood purity and intelligence tests – all of
    which attempted to give a rational and logical backing to what was a totally
    illogical idea: that humans from different places are inherently different,
    with some being superior and some being inferior. Malik writes of these
    scientists and thinkers that “asking the questions ‘how do we classify a
    race’ and ‘how many races are there’”, led them down one of the “blindest
    alleys in modern science” (p.40).
  </p>
  <p>
    It also gave rise to justifications for the worst horrors of the modern age.
    For instance, Malik rightly argues that Nazism and the policy of
    concentration camps were not an aberration but were developed out of
    practices drawn from other capitalist nations. In the chapter “Barbarism
    Comes Home”, Malik rejects the idea that the Nazis or the Holocaust emerged
    from thin air: “they were made possible by the ideas of race that had become
    deeply rooted in Western societies and by the practices of colonialism”
    (p.117). He also shows that much of the precedent for the categorisation of
    races and a legal framework for this was drawn by the Nazis from the United
    States. “Nazi lawyers, James Q. Whitman notes in his study of American
    influence on Nazi racial jurisprudence, ‘regarded America, not without
    reason, as the innovative world leader in the creation of racist law’”
    (p.130).
  </p>
  <p>
    Malik draws these connections and links, not to take away from the absolute
    barbarism of the Holocaust, but to show that:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Nazis drew upon pre-existing cultural attitudes and practices; that ideas
      about extermination and about “who should and should not inhabit the
      world” were commonplace in discussions of colonialism and “primitive
      peoples”. If we fail to recognize this, we not only entrench historical
      amnesia about colonialism but also face the jeopardy of normalizing
      colonial behaviour and attitudes. (p.139)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Of course, even when slavery was defeated through revolutionary struggles
    and social movements, racism did not disappear. It has continued to serve
    useful functions for the capitalist and ruling classes and remains deeply
    embedded in society. Black and brown people can be paid less than their
    white counterparts, forced into jobs and conditions that others won’t
    accept, made into scapegoats, and subjected to racist prejudice and abuse.
    However, identifying the origins of all these complex and contradictory
    processes is vital, both to reassert a materialist understanding of
    oppression and to point to the need to overthrow capitalism to end it.
  </p>
  <h2>Racism, colonialism and resistance</h2>
  <p>
    Malik argues that many anti-racists now dismiss the Enlightenment, including
    its universalism and rationalism, as Eurocentric, racist or conservative.
    But in contrast to this popular reading, Malik insists that for all its
    limits, the Enlightenment was given meaning through the struggles of
    oppressed and colonised people, and that its ideals inspired resistance
    among those who were oppressed.
  </p>
  <p>
    To flesh out this argument Malik draws on the revolutionary experience of
    Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian revolution. He argues that this was the
    third great Enlightenment revolution, following the French and the American
    revolutions (p.141). The Haitians also took the meaning of the Enlightenment
    further than their European counterparts and imbued it with new meaning.
    Where Enlightenment thinkers fused ideas of universalism with a cynical
    defence of slavery, the Haitian rebels were the first to truly champion
    justice for all. In doing so, they transformed the meaning of universalism
    and resolved one of the key contradictions of the Enlightenment (p.142).
    Malik recounts a story about slaves who had risen up against their masters
    and burned down buildings:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Just one building was left standing, in which had lived the insurgents’
      commander. Inside, on a mahogany table, he had placed the single book that
      had survived the incineration of Leclerc’s library – Raynal and Diderot’s
      <em>Histoire des Deux Indes</em>. It was open on the page that warned of
      the “terrible reprisals” that colonists would face if slaves were not
      emancipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was revolutionary trolling at its best. It is also a reminder of the
      complex relationship between the radicalism of the Enlightenment and the
      obscenity of slavery, of both the willingness of French revolutionaries to
      maintain human bondage and the inspiration that Enlightenment writing
      could provide for slave insurrectionists. (p.143)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Malik wants readers to remember this relationship between the radical
    Enlightenment ideals and the racially oppressed. Discussing CLR James’s
    writings on the Haitian revolution, Malik writes:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Louverture was significant to James not just because he had led the first
      great slave revolution; it was also that in so doing, he had made concrete
      the distinction between the immorality of European colonialism and the
      moral necessity of the ideas that flowed out of the Enlightenment. Most
      importantly for James, Louverture had shown how a struggle for
      emancipation could transform the meaning of universalism. (p.154)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    More broadly, discussions of the Enlightenment and Enlightenment values are
    central to the overall argument in the book. In discussing the shifts made
    through the Enlightenment period, Malik writes: “Over the following century,
    nature, not God, would come to sanctify the placing of ‘men in different
    stations’. Why did different peoples occupy different places in the social
    hierarchy? Because they were naturally – racially – different” (p.29).
  </p>
  <p>
    Malik argues that there are two strands to the Enlightenment and
    universalism – the liberal and the radical. He rightly points out that some
    of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers, such as Hume, Kant and
    Jefferson, combined “a defence of liberty and equality with profoundly
    racist ideas”. But others, such as Diderot, represent a radical strand that
    strove to “tear the old house of <em>ancien régime </em>society down and put
    another in its place” (p.24). <a id="_Hlk146800013"></a>These thinkers drew
    on the actions of revolutionaries such as the Levellers, which they believed
    could actually “make good” on the claims of the Enlightenment. They realised
    that to do so would require a fundamental transformation of society.
  </p>
  <p>
    So tension developed within the Enlightenment, and through the broader
    transformations going on at the time. Would the bourgeois revolutions end
    with a codifying of social differences masked by a rhetoric of equality, or
    would the ideas of the Enlightenment be pushed to their logical extreme?
    Malik sees current debates about race and identity as similar to those that
    played out in the Enlightenment. His central claim is that we need to return
    to the best of the Enlightenment’s universal ideals to confront racial
    oppression.
  </p>
  <p>
    But this raises a key weakness of the book, which is that Malik is fairly
    uncritical of classical liberal ideas. There’s a reason why the ideas of
    equality and fraternity were important for the emerging bourgeoisie. They
    were needed to justify the abolition of the rigid hierarchy of the feudal
    era, to allow them to climb up the class ladder and emerge as a new ruling
    class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Malik’s views echo those of the modernist writer Marshall Berman, who was
    similarly hostile to contemporary politics’ dismissal of the universal
    ideals of the Enlightenment:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Post-modernists maintain that the horizon of modernity is closed, its
      energies exhausted – in effect, that modernism is <em>passé</em>.
      Post-modernist social thought pours scorn on all the collective hopes for
      moral and social progress, for personal freedom and public happiness, that
      were bequeathed to us by the modernists of the eighteenth century
      Enlightenment. These hopes, post-modernists say, have been shown to be
      bankrupt, at best vain and futile fantasies, at worst engines of
      domination and monstrous enslavement.<sup

      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Both Malik and Bermann bristle at the way that postmodernists, or for Malik,
    Identitarians, reject modernism and Enlightenment thinking. But radicals and
    anti-racists need to go beyond the Enlightenment, building on its best
    elements while transcending its inherent limitations. For this project, Marx
    is a better guide than Malik and Berman, in that he abandons radical
    liberalism in favour of a perspective that is rooted in the class struggle,
    and sees the liberation of humanity tied up in the project of working-class
    self-emancipation. As capitalism has developed, and the working class has
    established itself as the largest class, a collective class, and one that
    tends towards struggle, Marx was right to say that the only road to a
    universal humanism runs through working-class revolution. This class is the
    only one that is capable of transforming society and overcoming both class
    and oppression.
  </p>
  <h2>Race and class</h2>
  <p>
    “Racial ideology was the inevitable product of the persistence of
    differences of rank, class and peoples in a society that had accepted the
    concept of equality.” (p.50)
  </p>
  <p>
    To give Malik some credit, however, he is far stronger on the question of
    class than most writers today. Throughout the book, Malik emphasises the
    close relationship between race and class and the way one’s class position
    informs one’s experience of racial oppression. He also makes the useful
    point that some questions that are usually understood as issues of race are
    actually laden with questions of class.
  </p>
  <p>
    To point to how we could overcome the “sharp end of racism”, Malik excavates
    the history of united working-class struggles against racism. He cites a
    number of examples, such as the trial of the Scottsboro boys, which was
    dismissed as unimportant by the middle-class NAACP. While the NAACP
    abandoned the Scottsboro boys to their deaths, the Communist Party fought
    for their freedom. It was the Communists, white and Black, who organised
    Black sharecroppers and the unemployed. Malik retells the important history
    of civil rights unionism which challenged colour bars, struggled for equal
    pay and campaigned against segregation through the Great Depression onwards.
    He shows how “as blacks organised side-by-side as equals ‘the aura of
    naturalness and inevitability that surrounded segregation’ cracked” (p.210).
  </p>
  <p>
    In thinking about the creation of race and class, it is useful to consider
    that as much as the categories of Black and Asian had to be created, the
    category of white had to be as well. Here questions of race and class are
    again relevant. The construction of a cross-class white identity took
    different routes in America and Britain. It was only with the racialisation
    of slavery that a cross-class “white identity” was really constructed in
    America. After that process took place, there was a desire to keep white
    blood “pure”, and so things such as discriminatory immigration practices,
    sterilisation and the like took hold. The issue remained fiercely contested,
    so Irish immigrants in the nineteenth century were basically seen as Black.
    Only when the fear-mongering about Irish immigration subsided were they able
    to be subsumed into the category of white. Malik explains this by arguing
    that the question of whiteness was “constructed as much out of fear as out
    of self-regard” (p.65). Having white or Irish workers and indentured slaves
    identify with Black slaves and workers would have presented a problem of
    class resistance to their rule. The creation of a white identity created a
    cross-class identification that, while false, could incorporate white
    workers ideologically, while separating them from their class comrades.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to the development of a white identity in America, the situation in
    Victorian-era Britain was quite different. There it was the working class
    who were seen as a “distinct breed”, and social status was in many ways more
    fundamental to social position than skin colour (p.79). Malik shows how
    those who protested against the injustices of the emerging capitalist system
    were described as “negroes” (p.83). But as capitalism and colonialism
    developed, a cross-class white identity again had to be forged, and by the
    second half of the nineteenth century, white skin became an “essential mark
    of a gentleman” (p.85).
  </p>
  <p>
    What Malik does well is show that race had to be constructed both in terms
    of whiteness and Blackness and that who fitted into which category could
    shift according to the needs and interests of the ruling class. There is
    nothing fixed about race. Even today, racial categories are made and remade.
    One only has to think about the way Muslims from all ethnic backgrounds were
    collectively racialised during the War on Terror, or the changing experience
    and identity of Greek and Italian migrants in Australia. Malik is also
    refreshingly insistent that any tendency for white workers to identify with
    the white ruling class is a false one, and does not serve their best
    interests.

  <p>
    Malik wants us to rediscover the history of working-class struggles against
    oppression in order to move past the pessimism of modern racial politics.
    These politics assume that we can never overcome racism, and the best we can
    achieve is a recognition of mutually antagonistic identities. Malik
    persuasively argues that working-class struggle can actually overcome the
    oppression people face. This argument is the bridge back to his earlier
    attempt to salvage the universalism of the Enlightenment. Malik thinks that
    we should fight to overcome racism, and “transcend the concept of race”, and
    to do this would require a “social revolution” (p.293).
  </p>
  <p>
    But although Malik argues that we need “not just an intellectual revolution,
    but a social one too”, it’s never spelled out what this revolution will look
    like, what social force will lead it, and what type of society would be
    built after it. Though much of the book is spent talking about the necessity
    of cross-racial working-class struggle, Malik never really argues that such
    struggles have the capacity to overcome capitalism. It’s also not clear what
    Malik thinks will lead to the social revolution he argues for. For that, a
    reader would best refer to Marxist classics on the topic, which make the
    case for working-class universalism while also defending the need to address
    specific grievances for racial minorities and other oppressed groups.
  </p>
  <h2>Identity politics</h2>
  <p>
    The last section of Malik’s book deals with the question of identity
    politics, which is the lens through which much of the left, both in academic
    and activist circles, view the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Identity politics adopts a fundamentally pessimistic worldview, one that
    sees racism, sexism and every other form of oppression as innate and
    eternal. It follows from this that the struggle against these oppressions,
    while admirable, is foredoomed to failure. The political horizons are
    narrowed; no matter how much we’d like, we can never really overcome
    oppression. Instead, we should highlight the marginalisation of oppressed
    groups and make people aware of their unconscious biases and
    micro-aggressions. Identity politics fractures the oppressed into smaller
    categories, rather than looking for commonalities between oppressed peoples
    and asking how could we end that oppression. This is a set of politics that
    says only someone who has a specific experience of identity or oppression
    can talk on that issue, and that there’s a hierarchy of oppressions and
    identities. If you are lucky enough not to be on the bottom of that pile,
    you actively engage in and benefit from the oppression of those below you.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the interesting arguments made in <em>Not So Black and White</em> is
    that the modern identity politics of today have roots in the conservative
    politics of the past. Against radical universalism, conservatives argued
    that human beings should be reduced to cultural backgrounds, that one’s
    identity was linked to one’s race, and that you had to protect racial and
    cultural groups from dilution (for example via eugenics or segregation).
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, the political right <em>and</em> left prosecute the argument that
    cultural groupings should remain distinct from one another. Many will be
    familiar with the claims of cultural appropriation made by much of the
    online and liberal left today. Malik posits that what the left and right
    have in common, by segmenting the population into cultural and
    identity-based groups, is a “hostility to universalism, a rejection of
    Enlightenment ideals as simultaneously ethnocentric, the product of European
    culture, and insufficiently ethnocentric, steamrollering cultural
    differences to impose a universalist perspective” (p.288). It should come as
    no surprise then that the political right are happy to employ politics of
    identity.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Most conservative critics of identity politics are not opposed to identity
      politics, just to the identity politics of the left. They despise Black
      Lives Matter for its “racism” and condemn the divisiveness of a concept
      such as “white privilege”. But they want to keep London (and Paris and
      Berlin) primarily white and to protect the European homeland from being
      colonized by marauding immigrants. All of which takes us to the deeper
      problem with the mainstream right’s embrace of white identity. The
      reactionary right – Nouvelle Droite, Generation Identity, the alt-right in
      America – uses the language of diversity and identity as a means of
      rebranding racism. (p.285)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    However, it’s not the case that the conservative right totally rejects
    Enlightenment ideas. They can and do use them to pursue racist talking
    points and justify forms of social inequality. Often they will talk about
    “not seeing race” or being “colourblind” in order to paper over the real
    oppression racial groups face. As well, countries like Australia have used
    official policies of “multiculturalism” in order to more subtly assimilate
    people into “Australian” capitalism and nationalism. Further, the right
    doesn’t only employ identity politics, they attack and lambast the left for
    its identity politics, with their current obsession with “woke culture”
    being the clearest example.
  </p>
  <p>
    So any real assessment of the situation suggests that both the Enlightenment
    and a rejection of it can justify racism. This goes against Malik’s claim
    that those who reject the Enlightenment are conservative (left-wing
    identitarians included) and those who embrace it are progressive.
  </p>
  <p>
    In discussing the question of left-wing variants of identity politics, Malik
    also takes a fresh look at the development of the Black Lives Matter
    movement in the United States. Using recent studies, Malik demonstrates that
    “police violence is correlated with poverty – the poorer a neighbourhood,
    the greater the risk of an individual being killed by the police. African
    Americans are disproportionately poor and working class; poverty and class
    location must also play a role in their being victims of police violence”
    (p.227). This argument is not made in order to downgrade the importance of
    the Black Lives Matter movement, or the centrality of racism to the
    construction and maintenance of inequality in the US. But without
    incorporating both race and class, it is harder to understand why police
    target specific Black communities, and harder to build coalitions with other
    workers and poor people who have an interest in fighting back together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oppressed groups are not homogeneous. Like every community, the oppressed
    are internally divided on all sorts of lines, the most important being
    class. Jay Z is not in danger of being stopped and frisked, nor will Beyonce
    ever need to work as a domestic servant to pay the bills. Malik writes:

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There is no single identity or set of interests that bind together all
      black people, and only black people; still less, all people of colour… To
      assume that there is only reinforces the power of the black elites and
      diminishes the voices of black workers, making it more difficult to tackle
      the problems facing those at the sharp end of racism. (pp.223–4)

    Malik’s arguments against identity politics are important ones, and largely
    valid. However, sometimes they verge on one-sidedness. It is true that it
    will take a working-class struggle to overcome oppression, but movements
    against particular forms of oppression can be vital beginnings for these
    types of moments, and such movements will often start with a focus on issues
    that affect a minority. As well, many people joining the left take the
    language of identity for granted, and so socialists need to patiently
    explain the limitations of these ideas, and try to win those concerned with
    oppression to a working-class and anti-capitalist perspective.

    It is also important to remember that our key enemies are the right and the
    reactionary racists, not those on the left who sometimes get things wrong.
    We can have debates and comradely disagreements, but our ire should be
    directed towards those who want to maintain and strengthen the racist
    institutions in our society. Debate on the left is necessary though, because
    our understanding of where racism developed from, who benefits and how we
    overcome it will be central to a successful anti-racist struggle. Malik’s
    book is a really useful contribution to that sort of discussion.
