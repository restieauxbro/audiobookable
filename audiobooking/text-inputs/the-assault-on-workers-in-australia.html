      Australian workers have been hit with the biggest drop in living standards
      in half a century. Since the end of 2021, real household disposable income
      has fallen from $62,000 a year on average to $56,000, according to
      Australian Bureau of Statistics data. And little is being done to
      alleviate the hardship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2010s, living standards didn’t increase much. But they jumped
      during the pandemic because of increased financial support from
      governments and the inability of households to spend much under the
      lockdowns. However they’ve been rapidly falling in recent years, for
      several reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      First is rising consumer prices. Over the past three years, prices have
      risen by more than 16 percent, according to the latest quarterly consumer
      price index figures from the Bureau of Statistics. Non-discretionary items
      (things you generally <em>must</em> pay for, such as food, electricity and
      rent) have gone up by nearly 20 percent. While headline inflation has
      dropped in recent months, things aren’t getting cheaper – prices are just
      rising at a slower pace than they were twelve months ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      With rising food prices, more people are relying on charity to get by.
      One-third of households experienced moderate or severe food insecurity in
      2023, meaning they compromised on their meal choices or skipped whole
      meals or days of eating, according to the latest Foodbank Hunger Report.
      Three-quarters of those experiencing food insecurity did so for the first
      time that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inflated prices have been blamed on supply chain disruptions, Russia’s
      invasion of Ukraine and catastrophic weather events. But another major
      factor has been the opportunistic profiteering of business owners. An
      Australia Institute report found that in 2022, Australian companies
      increased prices by $160 billion above their increased costs for wages,
      taxes and other inputs. That’s an extra $160 billion taken from consumers
      and pocketed as profits. The banks, supermarkets, energy companies and
      airlines are all in on it, recording record profits and payouts to
      shareholders. For instance, Woolworths’ net profit increased by 4.6
      percent to $1.2 billion in the last financial year; the big four banks
      have recorded higher profits in the last couple of years than their
      15-year average; and Origin Energy announced an 84 percent surge in annual
      profit in August last year (while energy prices were basically doubling).

      Second is the housing crisis. Twenty-five years ago, the average house was
      worth nine times the average disposable household income; now it’s sixteen
      and a half times, according to data from the Bureau of Statistics. Prices
      have risen astonishingly in some cities: 57 percent in Adelaide since the
      end of 2019, 51 percent in Brisbane and 38 percent in Sydney. Sydney’s
      median house price is now $1.6 million.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a lot of people are taking on a lot more debt, which has become more
      expensive to service. The average new mortgage nationally is about
      $620,000. Increasingly, young people can’t buy into the market without
      help – parental assistance for new home purchases is up from 12 percent in
      2010 to 75 percent today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repayments on expiring fixed rate mortgages taken out before interest
      rates started rising in 2022 have increased by an average of 64 percent.
      Average monthly mortgage repayments now range from $2,855 in the Northern
      Territory to $5,118 in New South Wales, according to calculations by
      Forbes Advisor Australia. To take a whole set of averages, a single person
      with an average mortgage on the average income would need to spend 3.6
      weeks of every month’s wage on mortgage repayments – this is clearly
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you do if you can’t buy a house? You rent, of course. But there’s
      serious trouble there as well. On average, rents have gone up by about
      one-third since mid-2020, and this trend is accelerating. In the first
      three months of this year, capital city rents rose faster than any other
      three-month period for the last 17 years, according to a report from
      property website Domain. And forking out a significant chunk of your
      income to a landlord is now a perverse privilege; rental vacancies are at
      a record low of 1 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, this is a crime with a culprit. Decades of Labor and Liberal
      housing policy have encouraged speculative investment in housing.
      Extensive tax concessions have helped a small minority purchase an
      increasing share of dwellings, while public housing stock has been
      annihilated, forcing an upward trend in prices for the rest of the housing
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, wages have not kept up with inflation. Rising prices wouldn’t be
      such an issue if wages were keeping pace. But since March 2021, wages have
      risen on average by 9 percent, while inflation rose 14.6 percent. The last
      three years have wiped out more than a decade of wage growth. As house
      prices jumped 30–50 percent over the last five years, wages rose only 12
      percent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) started to rise a little last
      year: the wage price index rose 4.2 percent while inflation rose 4.05
      percent. But there are caveats to this. Wages have not risen more than
      inflation on non-discretionary items (which is basically all that
      lower-income households are currently buying), and they have not risen for
      all workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, household savings are rapidly being depleted. Many
      households built savings buffers during the lockdowns, which helped to
      soften the financial blow of the last few years. But a report by
      comparison website Finder estimates that almost half of all households
      have less than $1,000 saved, and one in five have nothing at all. Only the
      top 20 percent of households have maintained their savings – these are
      people who earn so much that they are relatively unscathed by the
      cost-of-living pressures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one small solace of the last few years has been that unemployment has
      not risen sharply. When interest rates started to rise in 2022, many
      economists assumed that this would force a recession and push up
      unemployment. This hasn’t eventuated – for now at least. Nevertheless,
      unemployment is slightly ticking up from 3.5 percent in March 2023 to 3.8
      percent this March, and is rising faster for young people (youth
      unemployment is often a bellwether for broader unemployment trends). Also,
      many people <em>with </em>a job do not get paid enough to make ends meet –
      more than a half of those suffering from food insecurity have at least one
      family member in paid work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only options available to people to deal with these financial
      pressures are to reduce their standard of living by reducing consumption,
      work more or take on debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Bureau of Statistics, household spending plateaued late
      last year, rising only 0.1 percent, while spending on discretionary items
      fell by 0.9 percent compared to the same period the previous year. In the
      December quarter, businesses ran down the amount of stock they had on
      shelves and in storage: why stock items no-one can buy?
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of people working more than one job has increased to a record
      high of almost 1 million, and credit card debt (which has an average
      interest rate of 18 percent) is up 17 percent since September 2021,
      according to Reserve Bank figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s the statistical round up of where things are at, but to simplify
      the picture: over the last few years prices have gone up, real wages have
      gone down and people are taking on larger amounts of debt. Life is getting
      a lot tougher for millions of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the total wealth of Australia’s billionaires increased by 70
      percent in the first three years of this decade, according to the latest
      Oxfam Inequality Report, and fully doubled for the richest three
      Australians – two mining barons and a property developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Labor government has done little to ease the cost-of-living crisis.
      This is not surprising, considering the message they took into the 2022
      federal election. When Albanese replaced Bill Shorten as party leader in
      2019, he axed Labor’s mild program of wealth redistribution that included
      tackling generous tax concessions to the middle class and wealthy. Just

      But in order to provide relief for the millions of people struggling with
      rising costs, the government needs to make capital pay in one way or
      another: price caps, a super profits tax, restricting property investment.
      Capitalism is a zero-sum game between bosses and workers, particularly
      when the economy is in trouble. But Labor is first and foremost the
      “pro-business” government.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has claimed the tiniest of measures as great victories, for instance a
      $40 increase to fortnightly welfare payments and $500 energy subsidy for
      very-low-income households. But these are measly figures, and the
      households that receive them are still worse off than they were three
      years ago. They also only apply to a minority of people, welfare
      recipients, which holds to the neoliberal idea that government assistance
      should only happen on a small scale and only for the very poorest, rather
      than expansive policies that would benefit the working class as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Labor has trumpeted the Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF) as a major
      step in tackling the housing crisis. But when you crunch the numbers, the
      new funding is enough to build around 6,000 homes a year. There are
      currently 175,000 people on the social housing waitlist, and it’s
      increasing by 10–15,000 a year – so this policy won’t even keep pace with
      the rate in which the waitlist is <em>increasing</em>, let alone start to
      reduce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January, Labor announced changes to the deeply unpopular Stage 3 tax
      cuts, a Liberal government policy that was set to give the rich an extra
      $9,000 a year, while taxes on middle-income earners would increase. That
      Labor felt compelled to amend the policy after defending it for years
      reflects mounting popular pressure about the cost-of-living crisis and a
      dip in opinion polls for the government at the end of last year. But the
      new version is still a regressive tax policy. Those in the top income
      bracket (who earn more than $190,000 a year) will receive a $4,500
      reduction in their tax bill, while middle income earners will receive only
      a $780 benefit. The lowest 40 percent of income earners will receive less
      than 10 percent of the total benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to growing pressure about supermarket prices, the government
      commissioned a review headed by former Labor minister Craig Emerson. But
      the findings, which were handed down in April, will, if anything, raise
      prices for consumers. The inquiry focused on the relationship between the
      major supermarkets and their suppliers, and recommended a series of
      measures that would improve the bargaining power of suppliers. The
      supermarkets can then simply pass on any extra costs to consumers. Emerson
      tried to square this circle in an opinion piece for the
      <em>Financial Review</em>,
      <a
        href="https://www.afr.com/companies/retail/compulsory-grocery-code-strikes-right-balance-20240407-p5fhx6"
        previewlistener="true"
        >arguing</a
      >
      that suppliers would be better able to invest in “innovation and equipment
      that would enable them to offer better-quality products at lower
      prices”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      This argument exists in the same fantasy land as trickle-down economics.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s easy to think of policies that would <em>actually</em> ease the
      burden. In addition to those listed above, the government could
      substantially lift welfare payments and public sector wages, build more
      public housing and cap rents.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it’s not as though Labor isn’t spending any money. It has committed
      $370 billion to purchasing nuclear-powered submarines, provides more than
      $11 billion a year in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel
      industry, forgoes $50 billion a year with its property investor tax
      incentives and is cutting income taxes to benefit high income earners
      disproportionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greens under the leadership of Adam Bandt have taken something of a
      social democratic turn. Their strategy in the last election was less about
      challenging the Liberal Party in some inner-city blue-ribbon seats (a
      mantle taken up by the Teal independents), and more about relating to
      young people and those frustrated by Labor’s right-wing politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Labor took office, the Greens have publicly criticised some of the
      worst aspects of the government, most recently its response to the
      genocide in Gaza. They have positioned themselves as the party of renters,
      opposed the regressive Stage 3 tax cuts and called for Labor to raise the
      rate of welfare to $88 a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But political parties must be judged not just by what they say, but by
      what they do. And the Greens have done little. Despite holding the balance
      of power in the Senate, the Greens have not used this to force substantial
      concessions out of Labor. After criticising key policies like the HAFF,
      they have folded and ended up voting them through. This is no way to mount
      a challenge to a right-wing government.

    <p>
      For years, the primary strategy of the Greens has in effect been to hold
      the balance of power during a Labor government, and then negotiate from
      this position of strength. They have achieved this twice, from 2010 to
      2013, and again at the last election. But this strategy has borne no fruit
      for progressive social change. In 2010, all the Greens achieved was the
      establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office – a measure that is
      unlikely to make it to the history books. They are failing even on their
      own terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party’s glaring weakness is its commitment to electoral politics as
      the main, even only, way to change society. The Greens still occasionally
      refer to their activist roots, and some Greens politicians will speak at
      rallies or share activist events on social media. But they are not trying
      to mobilise their membership or support base to rebuild social movements
      or a combative union movement. This has been notable at the weekly
      demonstrations in solidarity with Palestine in Melbourne and Sydney, where
      at best only a handful of Greens flags can be spotted in the crowds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all political parties, their strategy flows from their analysis of
      the world: that capitalism is not in and of itself the problem, it just
      needs to be better regulated by intelligent politicians. Bandt spelled
      this out in an
      <a
        href="https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2020/may/1588255200/margaret-simons/adam-bandt-personable-hardliner#mtr"
        >interview</a
      >
      with <em>The Monthly</em> in 2020, arguing he would rather his daughters
      “live a long life under Green capitalism than a short, nasty, brutish life
      facing climate collapse”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      But the Green capitalism Bandt longs for is another fantasy – one only
      need look at the escalating carbon emissions, deforestation and rising
      temperatures. Having a few extra Greens MPs sitting in Canberra has done
      precisely nothing to turn the situation around.
    </p>
    <p>
      More recently, the Greens have embraced the supposed power of competitive
      market forces as a tool to tackle rising supermarket prices. In March,
      they introduced a bill seeking to introduce divestiture powers into
      Australian competition law to allow regulators to break up the supermarket
      duopoly. As though opening more IGAs or bringing back Franklins is going
      to lighten the load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the Greens are widening their support base, particularly
      among young voters. At the last election, they secured 12.2 percent of the
      general vote, but won a third of 18- to 34-year-olds. This likely reflects
      a new generation of voters who feel little hope about a future of
      skyrocketing housing costs and runaway climate change. It’s an important
      shift among young people, which hopefully can be funnelled into a more
      fruitful political project in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other institution one might expect to fight for workers in a time like
      this is the trade union movement. Again, things have been sadly lacking on
      this front. Union density is at an all-time low of 12.5 percent – which
      drops to 5 percent for workers in their early- to mid-20s – but there are
      still around 1.4 million union members in Australia. If mobilised, this
      power would be formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the approach of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has not been to
      organise and fight. Instead, it has pumped out endless surveys, inquiries
      and press releases. This is an elaborate way of doing nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s been a long time since there was a genuinely combative union movement
      in Australia, but it’s even worse under an ALP government. The union
      leaders are structurally and politically tied to the Labor Party and
      basically function as a wing of the government when Labor is in office.
      The unions talk a lot about the cost-of-living crisis, but their fire is
      aimed solely at major corporations, without a peep about the government.
      This is an utter betrayal of the union membership considering the scale of
      the assault on workers in Australia.

      Looking at how union politics have played out on a state level in recent
      years is instructive. There was an uptick in the number of workers going
      on strike in 2021 to 2022, largely due to a few big public sector strikes
      such as those by teachers and nurses in NSW when Dominic Perrottet’s
      Liberal government was in office. But the outcome was dismal. The unions
      wrapped up their campaign in the lead-up to the 2023 NSW state election
      and jumped on board Chris Minns’ Labor campaign. Only the teachers won a
      pay rise above inflation, which was partly reflective of the fact they
      were the worst paid teachers in the country and there were serious
      concerns that too many would leave the state during a teaching crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in Victoria the situation was even worse. The Australian
      Education Union signed with the Daniel Andrews Labor government to accept
      a 1.5 percent pay cap while inflation was already running above 5 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this could very well amount to a potential opportunity for the
      right. The European far right, and Trump, surged in popularity following
      the economic devastation of the Global Financial Crisis and austerity.
      While the same phenomenon is yet to gain prominence in Australia, we’re
      starting to get a whiff of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Dutton is trying to make a running from right-wing attacks on the
      Labor government and a series of racist scare campaigns. This is partly
      just reverting to the traditional Liberal party playbook, and partly
      because Dutton has little else to offer. The Liberals – who remain
      Australian capitalism’s A team – will not introduce sweeping economic
      reforms, even if they take the occasional populist potshots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year, Dutton argued that a surge in migration was responsible for the
      housing crisis. For the last 18 months, there has been a recurring
      hysteria about Indigenous children in Alice Springs, culminating in an
      evening curfew for under-18-year-olds in March and April. More recently,
      refugees have been in the firing line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Liberals are not the only ones fanning the flames. The mainstream
      media has predictably amplified every racist comment and fed the moral
      panics. Labor has either capitulated or been a willing participant in all
      these issues – it’s a Labor government in the Northern Territory that has
      swelled the number of cops on the streets of Alice Springs, and the
      Albanese government that is trying to imprison refugees who do not comply
      with their own deportation and to deny visas to residents of entire
      countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Labor continues to do nothing to address the cost-of-living crisis,
      more people could be open to such arguments. After all, immigrants and
      refugees have long been a useful scapegoat for the neoliberal hellscape.
      Migration is at the centre of right-wing politics in the UK, US and
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, it is a bleak time for Australian workers and politics. But
      there are some bright spots. That thousands of people have rallied week in
      and week out against a genocide happening on the other side of the world
      is cause for hope; as is the growing youth dissatisfaction with the state
      of society and mainstream political parties. Polling indicates that
      millennials are not following the well-trodden path of shifting to the
      right once they hit their mid-30s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dissatisfaction and despair can head in several different directions:
      depressed resignation, a right-wing backlash that picks the wrong targets
      to blame, or progressive movements that fight to make the world a better
      place. Politics and organisation determine how people respond at a time
      like this. We need to rebuild a genuine fighting left, in politics and in
      the unions. A left that won’t capitulate, compromise and sell out.
