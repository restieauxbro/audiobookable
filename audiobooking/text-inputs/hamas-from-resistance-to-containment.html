      The new <em>Nakba</em> taking place in Gaza has made it clearer than ever
      that the struggle for Palestine is a struggle against the entire system of
      capitalism and imperialism in the Middle East. Israel is a nuclear-armed
      ethno-state backed to the hilt by the US empire and all its allies.
      International organisations such as the UN have been powerless to
      intervene, reduced to putting out press releases pleading for aid to be
      restored. For months the Western media were uncritical cheerleaders of the
      Israeli genocide, regularly calling on supporters of the war while
      silencing Palestinians and their allies. Though the narrative is more
      mixed now, there is still an overwhelmingly pro-Zionist bias. As well, the
      Arab and Muslim regimes have been utterly passive in the face of this
      catastrophe, offering their tacit approval as Israel unleashes its
      destructive power against a defenceless population.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this can be explained with reference to the international system of
      profit and power. The Middle East is a strategically vital region for both
      oil and trade, and Israel is the most powerful state within it. Given the
      US is Israel’s primary ally, there is no chance that NATO members or other
      US allies such as Australia will do anything to seriously challenge or
      constrain Israel’s ambitions. And of course, institutions like the media
      are tools of the establishment, more likely to mindlessly reproduce
      imperialist propaganda than offer a critique. Within the Middle East, many
      of the region’s most important countries – think Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE
      – have long been integrated into the Western orbit, and have been steadily
      normalising their relationships with Israel. Those that haven’t are not
      interested in risking their own positions for the sake of solidarity with
      the Palestinians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within this situation, the first task of socialists across the world is to
      offer our solidarity to the Palestinians and their liberation struggle,
      and to respond to the endless lies and propaganda put out to justify
      Israel’s racist existence. To do this socialists in Australia and across
      the world have thrown ourselves into organising protests, sit-ins,
      pickets, blockades, camps, strikes and forums to grow and deepen the
      movement. But in the midst of this vital activism, there’s an urgent need
      to convince activists of the fundamental connection between capitalism and
      Palestinian oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the broader movement, the question of Hamas looms large. For Israel
      and its allies, Hamas is a terrorist organisation, the latest
      manifestation of the savagery and violence inherent in the Arab peoples.
      Its very existence serves as a self-evident justification for Israel’s
      most brutal actions. This argument reached its climax in the immediate
      aftermath of Hamas’s military operation on October 7, which shook a
      complacent and rightward moving Israeli society to its core. Led by a
      vulnerable yet tenacious Netanyahu, Israel has sought to save face by
      launching an unprecedented assault on the people of Gaza, ludicrously
      justified as self-defence. The enormous casualties and cruelties unleashed
      on the people of Palestine need not be described here, as they are well
      known and ever increasing. All of this has been outrageously justified as
      a campaign of self-defence against Hamas.

    </div>

    <p>
      The issue of Hamas also arises in the international solidarity movement,
      often for opposite reasons. Many supporters of Palestine have little idea
      about the <a id="_Hlk164953428"></a>history, politics or practice of Hamas
      (or its allies in Hezbollah or the Houthis). They are seen simply as the
      only group willing to resist Israeli aggression, which leads many to fall
      into fairly uncritical support for its actions and leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In developing an independent assessment of Hamas, we have to avoid
      simplistic reactions to Zionist propaganda or glorification of an abstract
      “resistance”. On one hand, we absolutely defend the Palestinians’ right to
      fight for self-determination, including with force. Yet defending these
      essential national rights does not require us to champion whatever
      organisation rises to the fore at a particular time, and certainly not to
      defend any and every tactic employed. That would be third world
      nationalism, not Marxism. Anti-imperialism is not as simple as putting a
      plus where the imperialists put a minus.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article will therefore attempt to put forward
      <a id="_Hlk164953007"></a>a Marxist assessment of Hamas as a political
      organisation. It will begin by <a id="_Hlk164953476"></a>exploring the
      decline of secular nationalism across the region and in Palestine,
      compounded by the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) acceptance of
      the treasonous Oslo accords. By then exploring their conservative approach
      to governing Gaza, their cosy relationship with reactionary capitalist
      forces in the region, and their inconsistent struggle against Israel and
      imperialism, it will become apparent that <a id="_Hlk164953493"></a>Hamas
      is incapable of achieving any kind of Palestinian liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much discussion about Hamas focuses on their conservative religious views
      or their attitude to armed struggle. But while these factors are
      important, they are secondary. The most essential thing to establish is
      their position within the political economy of Palestinian society, which
      invariably shapes their attitude to a range of vital political, economic
      and strategic issues. My argument is that <a id="_Hlk164953522"></a>the
      organisation represents a conservative form of bourgeois nationalism, one
      that marks a qualitative degeneration from previous eras of mass
      resistance in Palestine. As a bourgeois force, it is totally incapable of
      mobilising the type of revolutionary mass movement required to defeat the
      imperialist powers that oppress the Palestinians alongside the workers and
      poor across the Middle East.
    </p>
    <h2>The rise of Hamas</h2>
    <p>
      In developing a serious analysis of Hamas, we should start with its rise
      as a political tendency in Palestinian society. Hamas has built for itself
      a profile as a resistance movement within Palestine and in the broader
      Arab and Muslim world on the back of its rejection of the disastrous Oslo
      Accords. Its commitment to resistance resonated with those who refused to
      placidly accept the status quo of Israeli dominance, and its heartland
      being the beleaguered Gaza Strip meant that it has been on the front line
      of substantial social, economic, military and cultural attack by the
      Israelis. All these factors, in addition to their long-standing and
      relatively efficient welfare networks, transformed Hamas from its origins
      as a marginal rival to the hegemonic PLO into the most popular political
      organisation in Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamas was launched in December 1987, just as the first Palestinian
      Intifada was kicking off. But its roots go back to the early part of the
      twentieth century, with the formation of the Muslim Brotherhood. Initiated
      in Egypt by Hassan al-Banna in the late 1920s, the Brotherhood developed
      into a transnational network of clerics and activists organised around a
      modern yet socially conservative brand of political Islam. The Brotherhood
      sought to build up their supporter base by providing welfare services to
      the poor, funded by donations from the middle- and upper-class figures who
      led the organisation. This reliance on landowners, mosques and urban
      businessmen shaped its fierce hostility to Arab nationalism and the left.
      It was used as a weapon against socialists and nationalists throughout the
      anti-colonial era, and received substantial funding and support from the
      British puppet, King Farouk of Egypt. At various points during the Cold
      War the Brotherhood played an important role in fighting the left, both
      ideologically and physically. As reward the organisation would often
      receive funding and political support from various reactionary governments
      and sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Palestine, the Brotherhood had only a small base in Gaza from before
      the <em>Nakba </em>of 1948. Though Islamism was always stronger in Gaza
      than the West Bank, it was largely sidelined by the secular nationalists
      for decades. Islamic organising only really began to gain mass influence
      in the 1970s. Having said that, the Islamists had been encouraged first by
      Egypt, then after 1954 by Israel. This had allowed generations of Islamic
      organisers to patiently embed their religious, cultural and welfare
      organisations and their ideology in the wider population even as the
      nationalists and the left were harshly repressed.<sup

    <p>
      The standing of political Islam was given an immense boost by the Iranian
      revolution of 1979. Though it started as a popular and democratic
      rebellion against the Western-backed Shah, Khomeini was able to hijack the
      revolution to install a repressive theocracy, assisted by the leading
      Stalinist organisations. Despite its authoritarian and reactionary nature,
      the new Islamic republic skilfully played on the themes of
      anti-imperialism and social justice and won an international following.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeming success of this new regime in challenging the West contrasted
      greatly with the disastrous policies of the secular nationalists who
      headed increasingly authoritarian and neoliberal nationalist governments
      across the region. These regimes were no longer interested in even
      pretending to stand with the people of Palestine, highlighted by Egypt’s
      decision to make peace with Israel in 1978. The PLO had been unable to
      achieve any form of statehood; its terrible defeats in Jordan in 1970 and
      Lebanon in 1982 sent people looking elsewhere for inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The left in the Middle East, totally dominated by Stalinism, was also
      unable to pose an alternative. Communist parties and new left formations
      across the region largely tailed behind the reactionary post-colonial
      dictatorships, and in many cases even formed part of their
      pseudo-democratic governing coalitions. The Palestine Communist Party was
      never much of an attraction, having supported the partition of Palestinian
      territory in 1948 and for decades defended the right of Israel to exist,
      the most conservative position of any of the main Palestinian parties. The
      Popular and Democratic Fronts, which formed in a later era with an
      initially more radical platform, quickly moderated under the influence of
      their Stalinist “stages” theories and their opportunist alliances with
      reactionary figures such as Hafez al-Assad and Saddam Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having grown substantially as a result of their own efforts and the
      failure of the nationalist and left forces, the Palestinian Muslim
      Brotherhood was coming under increasing pressure for refusing to engage in
      resistance to Israel. A minority split to form the more militant Islamic
      Jihad in 1981. As sentiment for rebellion grew in the build-up to the
      First Intifada, a fierce debate broke out regarding the future of the
      group. The traditional view of the organisation was that charity work and
      the gradual “Islamisation” of society was a precondition for any
      liberation struggle. The majority, however, had now come to the conclusion
      that it was impossible to delay their engagement in active resistance any
      longer. This wing of the party did not explicitly reject the importance of
      Islamic welfare work, but rather argued that religious proselytising could
      and should co-exist with armed resistance. In this way the organisation
      known as Hamas was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already viewed with scepticism by the other factions, Hamas’s inaugural
      intervention into Palestinian politics did little to reassure its
      detractors. On one hand, it actively took part in the First Intifada along
      with everyone else. Yet even then there was a tendency towards
      militarising the struggle, and their activities were generally conducted
      separately from the other organisations grouped under the rubric of the
      PLO. Tareq Baconi, author of <em>Hamas Contained</em>, summarises their
      sectarian and politically reactionary approach:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Rather than joining the local leadership that was coordinating with the
        PLO to sustain the uprising, Hamas openly competed against it… The
        leaflets it published were different in language and feel from those
        officially issued by the intifada’s leadership. They introduced a
        religious element into an uprising that was not thought of by most
        Palestinians in particularly religious terms. Slogans from Hamas
        proliferated, its graffiti attacking Jews and Christians as well as
        secular nationalists.<sup

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      But like any mass rising, the Intifada could not sustain itself forever.
      Years of mobilisation and brutal repression saw thousands of leaders and
      activists imprisoned, and the base somewhat exhausted. The leader of the
      PLO, Yasser Arafat, picked this moment to start negotiations with Israel
      that have gone down in history as the Oslo Accords. From the outset these
      so-called “peace talks” were a trap to defuse the mass rebellion and
      convince the PLO to abandon central planks of its liberation program. But
      Arafat and the other bourgeois leaders of Fatah and the PLO were not
      simply victims of some Israeli trick: they were willing and active
      participants in the betrayal of the liberation struggle, selling all their
      principles for a cushy position within the international order of states.
      Sections of the left, alongside nationalist intellectuals like Edward
      Said, argued that Oslo would not grant Palestinians meaningful
      self-determination. But these criticisms were ignored, with Arafat and his
      team prepared to settle for a statelet consisting of Gaza and fragments of
      the West Bank. As a downpayment for this dubious result, the PLO accepted
      Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish ethno-state, along with its right to
      control 80 percent of historic Palestine, and renounced the armed
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political structure of Palestinian life we know today essentially took
      shape in this period. In return for giving up every single principle of
      Palestinian liberation, the PLO was allowed to set up a pseudo-state
      structure in the form of the Palestinian Authority. Critics remarked that
      the PA was neither Palestinian nor an authority, with Israel granted
      indefinite control over security, borders, trade, water, electricity and a
      host of other functions typically carried out by a state. Oslo ultimately
      collapsed because Israel had no intention of giving the Palestinians a
      single concession. But the failure of the negotiators to achieve a deal at
      Camp David in 2000 angered the Palestinian street, who rightly felt they
      had given up much and received nothing in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamas had steadily gained support and authority among Palestinians by
      opposing this disastrous process every step of the way. They denounced
      Arafat’s acceptance of the two-state solution, the growing security
      collaboration between Palestinian and Israeli forces and the tacit
      abandonment of Palestinian demands, including the right of refugees to
      return to their homes. Instead, it argued for a renewed resistance. It
      gained prestige from the Second Intifada, which definitely ended the Oslo
      process. This Second Intifada was a far more militarised affair than its
      earlier namesake, and far more under the control of the political
      factions. The rebellion saw guerrilla fighters from Fatah, Hamas, Islamic
      Jihad and the Popular Front engage in escalating armed attacks against
      Israeli targets. The mass of the population supported the uprising, but
      were far less involved than the last time around.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of Oslo, the Second Intifada and the election of a new Israeli
      government led by mass murderer Ariel Sharon pushed Hamas in new and
      contradictory directions. Hamas now sensed an opportunity to build on its
      support in Gaza and, for the first time, entrench itself as a leading
      faction in Palestinian politics. It decided to run in a series of local
      and municipal elections in 2005 and 2006, and achieved strong results. It
      then decided, after much internal debate, to contest for positions in the
      Palestinian Authority (PA). This was a big step for the party, which had
      rejected the PA as the bastard child of the Oslo process. The PA has no
      real power or control over the Palestinian territories. It is instead
      better understood as a quisling government, a Palestinian Vichy, which
      receives international funding and support in exchange for administering –
      and repressing – the Palestinians on behalf of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamas saw running in these elections as a means of confirming their new
      role as a major party within the Palestinian establishment. Party
      spokesman Ghazi Hamad set out the new approach:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Hamas presented an alternative, we said
        <em>negotiations alone are not enough</em> [my emphasis] to achieve our
        rights. What is needed is a Palestinian-led strategy, with a genuine
        consensus over aims and a proper balance between political and military
        struggle. But we also said the priority was reform and change in the way
        we are governed. How can we promise Jerusalem and the right of return
        when we can’t deliver our people a loaf of bread?<sup
          ><sup
            ><span class="floating-ref-link"
              ><a

              ></span
            ></sup
          ></sup
        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This superficially attractive formulation entailed a lowering of horizons
      from liberation to successful governance under occupation, a shift that
      has entailed policing the armed factions, repressing rivals and political
      compromise. Initially, their goal was not to win outright, but to form a
      coalition with Fatah and the other existing parties. But Hamas-backed
      lists did surprisingly well, giving the party unexpected control of most
      urban councils and a substantial majority in the Palestinian Legislative
      Council. This shocking result transformed Palestinian politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elected on a platform of “change and reform”, Hamas promised a break with
      the previous ten years of negotiations and humiliation. Although it
      continued to defend the right to resist Israel’s expanding occupation, the
      concept of resistance had now been radically redefined. Far from calling
      for a new round of protest or armed struggle, Hamas leaders offered modest
      promises: they would improve the corrupt and inefficient provision of
      essential services and walk away from negotiations that seemed one-sided.
      <a id="_Hlk164941353"></a>While on paper it upheld the long-term goal of
      unifying Palestine from the river to the sea, on repeated occasions Hamas
      offered Israel long-term truces based on the previously unthinkable: a
      Palestinian state within the 1967 borders.<sup

          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      >
      This programmatic convergence with Fatah and the PLO was designed to
      facilitate a coalition government. Even after winning a majority, Hamas
      offered Fatah a number of ministries – this despite the fact that the
      latter had an established history of collaboration with Israel and was led
      by US President George Bush’s hand-picked stooge, Mahmoud Abbas.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these historic concessions were not enough to placate Hamas’s enemies.
      Israel and its Western allies refused to accept the democratic process,
      lightly dismissing the outcome of a free and fair election because they
      did not like the result. Israel, the US and the EU immediately cut
      financial, diplomatic and military ties to the PA and placed sanctions on
      the new government. Emboldened by these acts of aggression – and,
      presumably, behind the scenes lobbying – Mahmoud Abbas initiated a
      partially successful coup against the newly elected legislature. Hamas
      easily rebuffed Fatah to maintain control over Gaza, but Fatah was able to
      use their existing power to establish a dictatorship in the West Bank that
      lasts to this day. The result was a Palestinian polity now divided in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Israel responded to Hamas’s victory by turning the Gaza Strip into a
      disaster zone, even before the latest offensive. They set out to punish
      the population for daring to elect Hamas. Prior to the latest assault,
      more than 2 million people lived in the tiny territory, more than 50
      percent of whom were unemployed. According to the UN Relief and Works
      Agency, around 80 percent of the population relied on international aid
      for their survival, and 95 percent lacked access to clean water due to
      systematic Israeli policies. The situation was established and maintained
      by a callous siege that denies the people of Gaza sufficient materials to
      live their lives. Israeli political and military leaders regularly talk of
      the need to “mow the lawn”:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Israel must wean itself from the naïve belief that improving the
        standard of living of the Palestinians in Gaza will reduce terror.
        Actually, the opposite is probably true. … Israel [has] wisely adopted a
        patient military strategy of attrition or “mowing the grass,” which was
        conceived, first and foremost, to harm the enemy’s capabilities.<sup
          ><sup

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This thinly coded language refers to the regular massacres of civilians in
      the Strip, and should put to rest once and for all the false narrative
      that Israel is merely responding to Palestinian provocations. The current
      genocidal attack is thus best understood as a new stage in this historic
      process of suppression and mass murder.
    </p>
    <h2>Hamas: repackaged bourgeois nationalism</h2>
    <p>
      When Hamas emerged from the 2006 elections as the most popular party in
      Palestine, it reflected the desire for a less corrupt and more
      resistance-oriented political leadership. Yet its time in government has
      seen it fall into many of the same practices and dead ends as its
      predecessors in Fatah and the PLO. Indeed, its slide from resistance
      organisation to an authoritarian regime prepared to negotiate with Israel
      was far more rapid than that of the PLO.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Marxist terms, Hamas is a <a id="_Hlk164955517"></a>classic bourgeois
      nationalist party. While many of their founders were impoverished refugees
      and low ranking clerics, the organisation has since evolved to being an
      institution with an annual budget measuring in the tens of millions of
      dollars. Much like the PLO, the party is both pro-capitalist and
      pro-market. Many of its leaders are filthy rich and possess huge
      investment portfolios, particularly in Turkey and the Gulf. This wealth
      was accumulated through real estate, Islamic finance and skimming off the
      top of international aid destined for Gaza. The party has cultivated
      relations with a range of capitalists across the Muslim world, using them
      to bypass sanctions, open diplomatic doors and as a source of donations.
      Hamas also has close connections with wealthy Palestinians in Gaza. Among
      other things, these figures help to fund and run the tunnel network that
      Hamas runs as a sort of public-private partnership. This raises revenue
      for the group in the form of taxes and bribes. This layer has also
      profited from the agriculture and hospitality sectors, and generally
      enjoyed much better lives than the millions of regular Gazans. There was
      no debate within the party when Hamas proposed a wealthy Palestinian
      businessman to be the minister of economy, trade and industry in their
      first cabinet, and two of the three candidates seriously considered for
      the key post of prime minister were Palestinian capitalists.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref6"

              class="reference-body-link"
              >6</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      This reflects the pro-capitalist attitudes of Hamas and the broader Muslim
      Brotherhood tendency within Islamism, which have always championed trade
      and private property as core pillars of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many commentators and experts have documented the way in which Hamas has
      gradually moderated its politics over time. The factors behind this shift
      include their growing affiliations with sections of Palestinian and
      international capital, their situation in Gaza shifting the group from
      resistance to governance, and the objective challenges of dealing with
      Israel’s ongoing siege on Gaza. In any case, Hamas has clearly shifted
      further towards reconciliation with Fatah’s governing principles – if not
      always the organisation itself – and, in a contradictory and uneven way,
      the Israeli occupation. Their practice right up until the attack on
      October 7, which will be discussed separately, also confirms this
      approach.

    <h3>1. The Liberation of Palestine</h3>
    <p>
      The traditional position of the Palestinian liberation movement was –
      rightly – to refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the Israeli state.
      Facing a colonial settler project originally initiated by British
      imperialism on an indigenous population, the Palestinians were and are
      fully within their rights to demand the destruction of the structures of
      occupation and their replacement by democratic institutions open to all
      those who live in the area formerly known as Palestine. This perspective
      is not simply a more just alternative to the status quo. Rather, the very
      existence of the apartheid structures and the perpetual expansion of
      Israel – which has racism and imperialism encoded into its very DNA –
      precludes any lasting and just peace. The abandonment of this perspective
      in favour of the so-called two-state solution was a disastrous concession
      to imperialism and a symptom of the broader degeneration of the left and
      nationalist forces. Accepting the two-state solution and Israel’s “right
      to exist” has never resulted in any gains for the Palestinian people. In
      fact after decades of negotiations and the creation of institutions
      designed to move in that direction, the situation for Palestinians in Gaza
      and the West Bank has never been worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, Hamas benefited greatly from being the largest
      faction to publicly and systematically oppose the Oslo Accords and the
      idea of a bantustan state. Article 13 of its first charter states that
      “so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences, are in
      contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref7"
              href="#_edn7"
              name="_ednref7"
              class="reference-body-link"
              >7</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      Yet as Hamas approached and eventually entered into positions of power,
      they quietly abandoned this position. <a id="_Hlk164941395"></a>The
      concept of a <em>hudna</em>, or long-term ceasefire, gradually entered
      their lexicon and has become an accepted element of their strategy. Based
      on a particular reading of Islamic texts, the concept developed as an
      attempt to straddle the conflicting requirements of diplomacy and
      resistance. It allows Hamas leaders to negotiate with Israel and the
      imperial powers while shielding the group from the accusation of selling
      out.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref8"
              href="#_edn8"
              name="_ednref8"
              class="reference-body-link"
              >8</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Given all this, the persistent accusations that Hamas refuses to
      acknowledge Israel’s supposed right to exist are cynical and disingenuous.
      In practice, Hamas has repeatedly accepted Israel’s existence. Its 2017
      charter maintains the organisation’s formal opposition to the foundation
      of Israel, the Oslo Accords that recognise it, and the PA’s subsequent
      collaboration with the Israel Defence Forces. But more importantly, the
      new document positions Hamas as a potential partner of government and
      negotiations within the framework of a reconstituted PLO, declaring the
      two-state solution to be a “formula of national consensus”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref9"
              href="#_edn9"
              name="_ednref9"
              class="reference-body-link"
              >9</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      But of course, what’s written in a party’s charter or platform is far less
      important than what the party says and does on a daily basis. In practice,
      Hamas’s attitude to Israel looks strikingly similar to that of Fatah in
      the early years of Oslo. Thus in 2001, just as the Second Intifada was
      getting started, a leading figure in Hamas put out a leaflet explaining
      that “Hamas and Islamic Jihad may agree to a temporary ceasefire, for a
      set time period such as ten years, during which the Palestinian people can
      create their own state within the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its
      capital, without giving up one inch of historic Palestine”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref10"

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      In 2003 Hamas agreed to a unilateral ceasefire with Israel, and by 2005
      Hamas had conceded further, signing up to the Cairo Declaration which
      promised to “maintain an atmosphere of calm” – that is, to stop attacks on
      Israel – in exchange for peace and the release of prisoners.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      In the aftermath of their election victory in 2006 Hamas agreed to
      “‘respect’ all past agreements signed by the PLO, on the basis that they
      supposedly ‘safeguard the interests of our people.’”<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      But like Fatah before them, Hamas have gained nothing from this
      backsliding. Israel has never accepted the Palestinian right to genuine
      self-determination, nor has it ever stopped building illegal settlements
      on stolen Palestinian land. Indeed, it refuses to even define its own
      borders. In January of this year, Netanyahu openly declared his opposition
      to ever granting the Palestinians any sort of statehood.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Anti-democratic rule</h3>
    <p>
      One of the tragedies of the Palestinian people is that they live with the
      weight of multiple layers of authoritarianism. They suffer under the
      genocidal Israeli occupation and the siege on Gaza imposed by Israel and
      Egypt, but also the authoritarian rule of the PA in the West Bank and
      Hamas in Gaza.

      It’s true to say that Hamas won a majority of seats in free elections back
      in 2006, and were immediately denied the chance to govern by Fatah and its
      imperialist supporters. In this sense, it’s impossible to say whether they
      would have governed in a democratic manner given the chance. Yet the party
      has clearly grown comfortable with its position as unquestioned rulers of
      Gaza. Fatah and its subsidiary organisations in Gaza have been repressed
      repeatedly over the years, and while Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front
      for the Liberation of Palestine can operate openly, they self-censor for
      fear of repression. Hamas have at times indicated they would tolerate new
      elections, but at other times indicated some wariness. Recently elected
      leader Yahya Sinwar made his reputation by personally executing a dozen
      Palestinians accused of being “collaborators” as part of his role heading
      up the organisation’s feared Internal Security Force. While it’s possible
      some of the accused <em>were </em>working with Israel, many were – and
      continue to be – killed simply for being gay.<sup

      When it comes to class struggle, Hamas have proven totally reactionary.
      Their hostility to the organising efforts of workers and the poor was
      exposed early in 2019 when protests across Gaza threatened to spark a
      general strike under the slogan of “we want to live”.<sup

      The movement was a response to persistently high unemployment in the Strip
      – not primarily Hamas’s fault, of course, given Israel’s siege – but also
      the government’s decision to raise taxes on cigarettes and a series of
      essential food items. The protest demands included establishing a labour
      office to protect workers’ rights, reduction of prices on staples, and the
      suspension of all taxes on essential goods. The protests were organised by
      a broad coalition of grassroots activists backed by every faction aside
      from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. When Mahmoud Abbas and the PA tried to use
      them as a means of undermining Hamas’s rule in Gaza, the activists put out
      a statement clarifying their stance, which sheeted home the blame for the
      crisis first to Israel and Egypt, then to the PA for not paying the wages
      of their employees in Gaza, and only then to Hamas.<sup

      None of this sophisticated messaging and political positioning stopped
      Hamas from physically crushing and politically slandering the movement.
      They responded by subjecting protesters to harsh beatings to drive them
      off the street. According to an excellent article by Salem Al-Rayes for
      the pro-resistance publication <em>Raseef22</em>, Hamas then arrested more
      than 1,000 people – including dozens of journalists and Palestinian human
      rights observers – whose cases were then referred to military courts.<sup

      The pretext was that stones were thrown; the Israelis would have been
      proud. All this repression was justified by depicting the movement as an
      agent of Israel and the right-wing Palestinian Authority. Thus the Hamas
      minister for refugee affairs, Atef Udwan, was quoted in an Emirati
      newspaper as asking protesters to leave: “Hamas will not fall and we will
      not hand over power to anyone, so for those who don’t like this, the Rafah
      crossing is open for them to emigrate.”<sup

      The protesters also pointed to the huge inequality among Palestinians in
      and around Gaza. Some held signs saying “we want to live the same life of
      luxury, money and cars as Hamas’ leaders’ sons”, while one viral video
      featured a woman attacking the same injustice:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Are we forbidden from saying we are in pain? Let people say what they
        want, why do you oppress them? All of Gaza is unemployed. Our children
        have lost 12 years of their lives. Why? Each child of a Hamas official,
        as soon as he is 20 years old, will own an apartment, a car, a jeep, a
        building and be married, while our sons have nothing in this life.<sup

    <p>
      This sentiment has grown as Hamas has become increasingly corrupted by an
      extended period of one-party rule. The most infamous symbol of this is the
      extraordinary wealth of Hamas leaders and family members outside of Gaza,
      who live the decadent lives of luxury you would expect from members of the
      Gulf royal family. So while many supporters of Hamas are happy to cite
      Fanon’s defence of anti-colonial violence approvingly, his denunciation of
      the corruption and self-interest among the post-colonial elite is at least
      as pertinent. His final book, <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em>, is
      famous for its defence of revolutionary violence, yet it is also filled
      with rage at the new class of local leaders that replaced the old colonial
      elite. The chapters on the perils of national consciousness and
      spontaneity are chock-full of insights as to the limits of bourgeois
      nationalism and the self-appointed leaders of the struggle:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Certain natives continue to profiteer and exploit the war, making their
        gains at the expense of the people, who as usual are prepared to
        sacrifice everything, and water their native soil with their blood. The
        militant who faces the colonialist war machine with the bare minimum of
        arms realises that while he is breaking down colonial oppression he is
        building up automatically yet another system of exploitation. This
        discovery is unpleasant, bitter, and sickening: and yet everything
        seemed to be so simple before: the bad people were on one side, and the
        good on the other. The clear, unreal, idyllic light of the beginning is
        followed by a semi-darkness that bewilders the senses. The people find
        out that the iniquitous fact of exploitation can wear a black face, or
        an Arab one; and they raise the cry of “Treason!” But the cry is
        mistaken; and the mistake must be corrected. The treason is not
        national, it is social.<sup

    <p>
      In the case of Palestine, the situation is even worse than Fanon imagined,
      because the elites have been corrupted while colonialism remains in place.
      Yet his insistence on grounding the failures of bourgeois nationalists in
      their material privileges is absolutely spot on, and is forgotten by third
      world nationalists.

      As with ruling classes across the world, Hamas has attempted to use
      culture wars around issues of oppression to consolidate their popularity
      and clamp down on opposition. In Gaza this has taken the form of
      soft-Islamisation drives, and it is women who have been the most public
      and sustained victims of these efforts.<sup

      Hamas has attempted to force women to wear the hijab in public
      institutions and to ban them from smoking in public, along with other
      generalised policing of their behaviour. Resistance on the ground has
      resulted in many of these policies being abandoned or delayed. In one
      incident, two prominent women publicly unveiled themselves, in opposition
      to the increasing religiosity of Gazan society. In their public statement
      the activists were careful to blame Israel’s siege and occupation, as well
      as Hamas, for the growth of conservative politics in the strip.<sup

      LBGT people have also been harassed and killed by the regime, on the
      reactionary basis that LBGT individuals can be more easily turned into
      informers. For all these reasons and more, as early as 2010 Palestinian
      researcher Khaled Hroub was arguing that:

        Hamas’s view[s] – is an egregious deed that must be opposed. It is the
        reenactment, under a religious guise, of the experience of [other]
        totalitarian regimes and dictatorships.<sup

      In practice then, Hamas have long abandoned the full liberation of
      Palestinian territory, and their rule over Gaza is characterised by
      pro-market and pro-rich policies, anti-democratic suppression of free
      speech and assembly, and conservative clericalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      These experiences have led Gazans to be increasingly critical and
      distrusting of Hamas over the years. An extensive survey of Palestinian
      public opinion organised by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey
      Research, conducted just before October 7 last year, found that just 32
      percent of likely voters in Gaza would have voted for Hamas in
      hypothetical elections, with 32 percent preferring Fatah. This is down
      from 44.5 percent Hamas won in the 2006 legislative elections.<sup

    <h2>Hamas and the armed struggle</h2>
    <p>
      Despite Hamas offering endless concessions and compromises, Israel has
      refused to grant any of their core demands. The paralysing siege has been
      maintained, as have Israel’s strict controls over food, migration, the
      economy, and everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, faced with endless Israeli oppression and a growing
      domestic hostility to Hamas’s reactionary policies, armed resistance takes
      on a new meaning. To some extent it remains a tactic deployed to improve
      Hamas’s negotiating hand, and at times has resulted in the release of
      Palestinian prisoners, a partial loosening of the siege, or some other
      minor concession. But just as importantly, the use of armed force is a
      form of political communication to a<em> Palestinian</em> audience, and is
      a proven way of winning mass support. For instance the October 7 attack
      has massively boosted its support among Palestinians and the wider Arab
      world, particularly in the West Bank. The same polling agency that
      identified cratering support for Hamas prior to October 7 found its
      popularity nearly doubled in Gaza and more than doubled across Gaza and
      the West Bank.<sup

          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      This surge in public opinion would seem to be matched across much of the
      Arab world, where figures from Hamas’s armed wing, such as Mohammed Deif
      and Yahya Sinwar, are lauded as heroes in the struggle against Israeli
      colonialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a Marxist point of view, it has to be said directly that occupied
      peoples have the right to resist their oppression, including using armed
      force. Even bourgeois legal theory recognises this right, which is
      enshrined in the Geneva conventions of 1949. Resistance to unjust foreign
      and colonial occupation forms a core part of the folklore of countries as
      politically diverse as France, Iraq, India, and Vietnam. And there is no
      question that Palestine is being occupied, not just in lands stolen since
      1967, as is usually understood, but across the land spanning from the
      Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. So armed resistance by Palestinians
      is a legitimate tactic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the Palestinian people have consistently been defined as terrorists
      for resisting the occupation of their country. From the very beginning of
      the Israeli occupation of their land, a racist narrative was established
      that distinguished between Arab savages and civilised European Jews.
      Israel and its Western allies opposed Palestinian resistance long before
      the existence of Hamas. This reflects an Israeli desire to crush any and
      all sources of opposition to the entrenchment and expansion of Israel’s
      colonial expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confronted with endless Israeli violence and provocations, multiple
      generations of Palestinian activists have insisted that resistance in
      general, and armed resistance in particular, is both their right and an
      absolute necessity. Yet given the overwhelming advantages possessed by the
      Israeli military, attempts at specifically <em>armed</em> resistance have
      generally failed to weaken the Israeli occupation or deliver lasting
      results. For decades Fatah oscillated between phases of armed struggle and
      tortured peace talks, neither of which effectively hindered Israel’s
      colonial expansion. Oslo was their final surrender, but it could have been
      foretold from the very beginning, given the utopianism of their
      alternative strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The First Intifada was a brief respite from this pattern precisely because
      of its mass character. Tens of thousands of Palestinians found their voice
      by taking part in the years-long uprising, which involved street protests,
      strikes, union organising, student actions, rent-strikes, boycotts and
      more. The mass nature of this resistance made it harder for the Israelis
      to unleash overwhelming violence, and gained the movement access to
      international support. Unfortunately, rather than build on the
      possibilities created by this movement, Arafat and Fatah sought to
      leverage it into hopeless peace talks that later became known as the Oslo
      Accords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamas started on this journey from military resistance to diplomatic dead
      ends decades later, but has traversed similar ground. Their early attacks
      targeted the Israeli military and illegal settlements. This position was
      abandoned following the massacre of Palestinian worshippers at the
      Ibrahimi mosque by a fascist Israeli settler during Ramadan in 1994. This
      outrageous attack pushed Hamas to adopt a similar tactic of targeting
      civilians. But every attack by Hamas and other resistance groups was
      followed by Israeli reprisals, each more brutal than the last, a chain of
      escalating violence which led to thousands of dead Palestinians.
    </p>
    <p>
      This campaign of terror attacks – the correct technical word for blowing
      up cafés or buses in civilian areas – continued for years, and was a total
      disaster for the Palestinians. It did not weaken the Israeli occupation
      one iota. In fact, the attacks gave Israel the excuse to expand and deepen
      its control over the West Bank and Jerusalem, including the construction
      of the apartheid wall. At the same time, it gave the Israelis and their
      international propaganda machine – otherwise known as the mainstream media
      – an excuse to smear the Palestinian movement. Less importantly, but still
      of some relevance, the attacks helped accelerate the Israeli public’s
      trajectory towards the far right, and empowered the most militaristic and
      aggressive factions. So the campaign of terror attacks – which also
      included members of other factions, including Fatah – was a total
      disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      This failure to achieve anything positive is fairly typical of terrorist
      tactics, which is why Marxists have generally opposed them, from the Irish
      Troubles right back to the days of Bakunin and the Russian Narodniks. Even
      when they are successful, the type of secretive and minoritarian
      organising involved in these methods undermines the possibilities of
      democratic, let alone socialist, outcomes for the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much internal and external debate, Hamas gave up the suicide bombing
      tactic in 2005. Aside from the most recent events on October 7, the crux
      of Hamas’s military struggle in the last 20 years has involved the fairly
      indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israel. News of a round of rocket
      fire is inevitably reported with breathless horror by international
      journalists based in Israel. But the reality is that Hamas’s relatively
      primitive rockets pose almost no threat to Israeli society. According to
      the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, just 21 people in Israel were
      killed by this method between 2000 and 2013, some of whom were temporary
      migrant workers.<sup

      So as a military tactic, rockets have proven woefully inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supplementing the rocket attacks have been occasional incursions into
      Israeli territory, where Hamas and other armed groups seek to capture
      Israeli soldiers to trade for Palestinian political prisoners and the
      slight loosening of the siege on Gaza. This tactic has been of some
      utility, at times forcing Israel to release thousands of Palestinian
      prisoners. But it is by nature a fairly defensive measure, with no
      prospects of ending the occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the aftermath of October 7, a debate has emerged on the left about how
      to respond to the attack, and by proxy, armed resistance more broadly.
      Many have adopted an approach of unconditional and uncritical support for
      Hamas and its military actions, celebrating October 7 as a moment of
      liberatory potential. But Marxists need to judge tactics concretely and
      politically. While armed self-defence and insurrection can be an important
      part of mass mobilisations, and certainly revolutions, the military aspect
      must always be subordinated to a broader political strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two factors in assessing any tactic and strategy. The first is
      to judge whether it can assist in the struggle for Palestinian
      self-determination. Of course, no single act or campaign will achieve full
      liberation, so the assessment is whether it helps take the struggle even
      one small step forward, either by strengthening our side or weakening the
      enemy in some way. When judging the utility of any action, we should ask
      whether it contributes to the building of a movement that can achieve
      genuine liberation, and whether it is deployed as part of a coherent
      strategic vision to that end. That is as much true of a strike or protest,
      say for a wage rise or climate action, as it is of the armed struggle. The
      second is what type of social system and political dynamics are implicit
      in or unleashed by the method of struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Palestine, the armed struggle has always had an attraction due to the
      violence and brutality of the Israeli state. Through their resistance
      Palestinians have discovered and rediscovered their national pride and
      dignity. But the problem with any strategy that relies primarily on armed
      resistance is that Israel possesses by far the most powerful military in
      the region. Imperial powers have offered Israel billions in military and
      economic aid, meaning that its military capacities dwarf those of the
      Palestinians. And while the early PLO was rightly inspired by the heroic
      Vietnamese resistance to US occupation, the two situations are
      fundamentally different. The US empire could eventually be forced to
      retreat from Vietnam with its tail between its legs, but the Israeli
      ethno-state state has nowhere to go, it must fight to the death. So while
      the willingness to participate in or support armed resistance often
      expresses the courageous refusal of the oppressed to give up their
      struggle for freedom, in the Palestinian context there are real limits to
      its utility. That’s especially the case now that the Israeli state is an
      entrenched presence in the Middle East, with abundant weapons, deep
      pockets and powerful friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as Hamas have adopted many of the same principles of Fatah, their
      commitment to armed resistance has remained their primary distinguishing
      characteristic. There is no argument put forward about how sporadic rocket
      fire or kidnappings can help achieve a free Palestine. Indeed, aside from
      October 7, which took Israel totally by surprise, Hamas’s attacks are
      fairly symbolic gestures. There is simply no possibility of a substantial
      <em>offensive</em> military victory against the Israeli army, and Hamas
      does not present a serious program to overcome the structural imbalance of
      power. In this sense, the armed resistance the party launches from time to
      time is more usefully understood as a political stunt, a means by which
      Hamas leaders exploit the admirable bravery and commitment of their rank
      and file to gain attention and assist the party in winning small
      improvements through their negotiations with Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course stunts can be effective, if paired with a broader strategy. Yet
      as well as being incapable of defeating Israel, the armed struggle is also
      directly counterposed to the type of mass revolutionary resistance that
      can achieve the type of radical democracy and economic equality needed for
      true liberation for the Palestinians. Military struggle, especially by
      guerrilla fighters, is inherently top-down and secretive. Planned attacks
      cannot be promoted in advance, and its protagonists are restricted to
      small groups of fighters rather than the mass of the population. The
      evidence for this counterposition is abundant. The radical potential of
      the Second Intifada was quickly subsumed by the armed attacks unleashed by
      the various political factions. A similar process took place in 2021,
      where an ongoing grassroots campaign of protests and strikes against the
      eviction of Palestinians from occupied East Jerusalem was essentially
      squashed after Hamas decided to fire rockets at Israel – and thereby
      initiate a cycle of violence. This action increased Hamas’s popularity as
      a national resistance force, but curtailed the possibilities of ongoing
      mass mobilisation. Even in countries where the armed struggle has
      succeeded, national liberation by this means did not deliver democratic
      results. So in Vietnam, Algeria and elsewhere, the elite bands of
      guerrilla fighters who led the national liberation struggles simply
      installed themselves as the new oppressive dictators. For socialists, who
      are not nationalists, but are interested in pushing every struggle towards
      revolutionary democracy and economic justice, such an outcome in Palestine
      would be totally unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most damning proof that the armed struggle as carried out by
      Hamas poses no threat to Israel can be found in the actions of the
      Israelis themselves. Paula Caridi’s invaluable book on Hamas documents in
      detail how Israel has repeatedly intervened to prevent the party from
      silencing its armed wing. On multiple occasions the Palestinian factions
      have been close to agreeing to ceasefires based on a program of dialogue
      with Israel on the grounds of the Oslo agreements, only to have the talks
      sabotaged by Israel. During its suicide bombing phase, Hamas offered to
      stop targeting civilians on three separate occasions, on the proviso that
      Israel agreed to do the same. Israel did not agree. Another time, the
      Palestinians were close to negotiating a truce among themselves, and to
      abandon suicide attacks altogether. When Israel found out, they dropped a
      one tonne bomb on the home of a Hamas leader, scuttling the prospect for
      years to come.<sup

    </p>
    <p>
      This history makes it clear that Israel has never been interested in peace
      with the Palestinians, and certainly not with Hamas. But it also reflects
      their supreme confidence that armed Palestinian resistance poses no threat
      to Israel’s survival. Reinforcing this point, Israeli journalists have
      recently exposed the extent to which Netanyahu had been happy to fund
      Hamas – including its military wing – via Qatar. His rationale was that
      maintaining the division between Hamas in Gaza and the PA in the West Bank
      precluded any implementation of a two-state solution. This strategy of
      supporting the Islamists to weaken Fatah goes back decades. But if Hamas
      or its strategy posed any fundamental threat to Israel, this would not
      have been a viable option.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some extent, the events of the last six months have fundamentally
      transformed the situation. It is too soon to know exactly what Hamas was
      thinking in launching the attack on October 7, what the result of Israel’s
      murderous response will be, or indeed what will happen inside Israel
      itself. There are many, many moving parts. But already it’s clear that the
      military “achievements” of October 7, dramatic as they were, have not
      advanced the Palestinian cause by a single step. Never before has any Arab
      force done so much damage to Israel, and yet the result has been an
      unimaginable setback for the Palestinian cause, comparable only to the
      <em>Nakba</em> of 1948.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamas and its supporters have attempted to argue that the current
      situation marks a victory for the Palestinian cause. Sometimes it is
      argued that Hamas can claim credit for the current surge in public support
      for the Palestinians around the world. But this is a real stretch – by
      that logic Osama bin Laden could have taken credit for the historic
      movement against the Iraq War. The mass rallies have not occurred as a
      result of October 7, but despite it. They reflect a humanistic and
      solidaristic response to Israel’s genocidal massacre, and the integration
      of the Palestinian struggle within a broader anti-racist framework popular
      among sections of youth. Others have argued that Hamas simply needs to
      survive Israel’s onslaught to have achieved victory. But the best case
      scenario for Hamas is a new “truce” that allows them to maintain their
      hegemony over what’s left of a ravaged and diminished Gaza. It is hard to
      see how anyone could argue that such a scenario would represent an advance
      for the people of Palestine from the status quo before the war. The
      fundamental error here is conflating Hamas’s interests – for whom
      surviving the war would clearly be an achievement won at the expense of
      enormous Palestinian misery – with those of the Palestinians.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, there is much yet to play out before a definitive judgement
      can be made on recent events. But for now we can say that the attack has
      given the bloodthirsty Israeli establishment an excuse to inflict an
      historic defeat of the Palestinian people. The numbers of Palestinian
      casualties and refugees are unprecedented, as is the physical obliteration
      of the Gaza Strip and Gaza City, Palestine’s second largest urban centre.
      While it is understandable that people seek to psychologically cushion
      themselves from the terrible truths about the unfolding genocide,
      socialists have a responsibility to look reality in the face. How many
      more such “successes” can the Palestinian people afford?
    </p>
    <h2>Revolutionary alternatives</h2>
    <p>
      The Palestinians’ struggle has oscillated between armed resistance and
      peace talks for decades, in two major cycles. The first was led by Fatah,
      starting around the time of the battle of Karameh in 1968, and ending with
      the betrayal of the Oslo agreement. The second was driven by Hamas,
      starting in the late 1990s, spurred on by growing frustration with Oslo,
      and ended with the decades of uneasy coexistence between Hamas and Israel.
      October 7 shattered that status quo, and it is too early to know what
      comes next. But regardless, it’s clear that the bourgeois nationalist
      leaderships of both Fatah and Hamas have failed to bring the Palestinians
      a single step closer to liberation. In the words of Palestinian
      intellectual and journalist Haidar Eid, Palestinians face the choice
      “between the religious right and the secular right, while a necessary
      alternative is absent from the field”.<sup

    </p>
    <p>
      The fundamental reason is that both are trapped within the framework of
      bourgeois nationalism, which seeks simply to claim a place for Palestine
      in the international capitalist order. The problem with this perspective
      is that the Israelis and their imperial backers do not want such a
      situation, and have not accepted any limits to their colonial expansion.
      The Arab and Muslim states, which have been looked to for support by
      generations of Palestinian organisations, similarly have no interest in
      confronting the complex web of economic and geopolitical relationships
      that prop up Israel. Indeed, they are part of the system. The Palestinians
      cannot defeat the armed might of this international alliance of capitalist
      reaction on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why the left has always understood <a id="_Hlk164957098"></a>the
      issue of Palestine as intrinsically linked to that of regional and global
      imperialism. Partly this is because the creation of Israel was never
      simply about disempowering the Palestinian people, but was an attempt to
      implant a loyal, pro-Western entity in a region that has enormous
      strategic significance due to its large oil reserves. Since its creation
      Israel has helped maintain first British and then American hegemony in the
      region, in the process disciplining any Arab states that have threatened
      to challenge the status quo, even in minor ways. Israel has been an attack
      dog that has sought to preserve the unequal economic and geopolitical
      structures of the Middle East and North Africa, often in conjunction with
      sections of the ruling class in the Arab world, most notably the Gulf
      States, to stem the revolutionary movements that have periodically swept
      the region. In this way the settler society set up by the Zionists has
      proven to be a highly effective outpost of Western imperialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also another reason it’s important to understand the Palestinian
      struggle as a regional and even international one. This relates to the
      structure and nature of the society that has emerged as a result of the
      historical struggle between Zionist settlers and the indigenous
      Palestinian inhabitants. In this case, rather than incorporate the
      indigenous population into the workforce as in South Africa, the European
      colonists attempted to ethnically cleanse the land entirely. But unlike in
      Australia, Canada and the US, the Zionists have not been so successful as
      to wipe out the vast majority of the original inhabitants. Instead, the
      numbers of settlers and indigenous inhabitants are roughly equal, with
      millions more Palestinians dispersed as refugees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is a hybrid structure, where a highly sophisticated capitalist
      society has been built on top of and in opposition to the former
      inhabitants of the land, but one that is still forced to engage in
      frontier wars. The result is a perpetually mobilised and racialised Jewish
      society which, despite its various social and economic stratifications, is
      easily united against its Palestinian or Arab enemies. The Jewish Israeli
      working class has never acted from an internationalist perspective,
      prevented from doing so by the ideological prison owned and organised by
      the Jewish colonial elites. There are few countries on earth where
      nationalism has been more effective in deferring and distorting the
      dynamics of class struggle than Israel, and there is no prospect of this
      changing in the short to medium term.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, there is no sense in which the Palestinian working class
      is capable of fundamentally challenging the racist structures of Israeli
      society on its own, as occurred in South Africa during the 1980s. For
      Palestinians, the exclusionary and genocidal policies of Israel mean there
      is not a sufficient working-class base from which to launch a
      revolutionary insurrection against the racist superstructure of the
      Israeli state. There are a few hundred thousand Palestinian workers who
      live in the West Bank and work in Israel. Then within Israel itself there
      is a sizeable number of Palestinian workers. But it is the case that
      Palestinians are not central to production except in a few secondary areas
      like construction and agriculture. For the most part, Palestinians are
      forced to live on the margins of Israeli society. They are subject to its
      whims while lacking any serious capacity to influence its decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      A regional strategy is necessary to find such a force, which is why Arab
      revolutionaries have long argued that the road to Jerusalem runs through
      Cairo, Baghdad and Damascus. There, millions of workers exist and have the
      capacity to bring down the capitalist and imperialist networks of power
      that dominate the region. Fatah’s refusal to play a role in catalysing
      this sort of struggle saw the Palestinian movement and the broader left
      crushed in both Jordan and Lebanon through the 1970s and early ’80s.
      <a id="_Hlk164957248"></a>An international movement that links the
      democratic and economic demands of the people of the region with freedom
      for Palestine is the only hope for justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arab Spring was a moment of momentous opportunity for the Palestinian
      cause. While enormous sympathy for Palestine was evinced as part of the
      Arab Spring of 2011, the Palestinian leaders failed to offer it meaningful
      political support or make demands for practical solidarity. Fatah, tied to
      the Saudi elites, essentially backed the old order. Hamas allied itself
      closely with the neoliberal government of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
      and its co-thinkers internationally, which used Palestine as a fig leaf to
      distract from its reactionary economic and social policies. But this too
      was done out of pragmatism, rather than democratic principle. While Hamas
      initially supported the protest movement against the criminal Assad
      regime, when it became clear that Assad would survive thanks to the
      intervention of Iran and Russia they turned their back on the rebels and
      sided with the regime.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to these sordid dealings, a genuinely revolutionary resistance
      would have understood that the fate of Palestine lay with the fate of
      these revolutions. But as well as exposing the limits of Fatah and Hamas,
      the revolutions of 2011 and 2019 proved that simply overturning the old
      regimes and replacing them with another form of capitalist rule would not
      be sufficient to achieve the changes desired. Only a socialist
      revolutionary movement that sweeps the capitalists, militaries, the
      clerics and the sectarians from power across the region could then set its
      sights on Palestine. Such a movement would necessarily be led by the
      <a id="_Hlk164957317"></a>working class, the only genuinely
      anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist force in the Middle East.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today this argument is obscured by the fact that this new generation of
      Palestine supporters are being politicised in a context where
      working-class and socialist politics are at an historic nadir. This is
      true not only in the Middle East, but across much of the rest of the
      world. In this ideological vacuum it is common for people to fall into
      classless third world nationalism, manifesting now as “anti-colonial”
      discourse. In this rubric, Palestine supporters can find themselves
      cheering on the military stunts conducted by the Houthis in Yemen, the
      neoliberal South African government’s decision to take Israel to the
      International Court of Justice and the October 7 attack by Hamas. Each of
      these actions are believed to represent opposition to Western imperialism,
      but there is no broader strategic vision which would allow for a judgement
      about their efficacy or utility for the liberation movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article has attempted to advance a more serious assessment of Hamas
      and its strategies. The Palestinian people have suffered far too much over
      the years, primarily at the hands of the Israelis, but also the Arab
      regimes, and due to the missteps and failures of their own leaders. The
      situation today in Gaza is intolerable. The strangulation of the Strip by
      Israeli and Egyptian forces has continued for over a decade, leaving many
      unable to access the most basic necessities of life. There have been no
      national elections since 2006, as Fatah and Hamas have preferred to
      entrench themselves in their respective bases than risk the political
      judgement of the people they claim to represent. Nor are there political
      parties that can challenge the domination of these two organisations,
      offering an alternative to their failed approaches. Meanwhile Israeli
      society continues its drift towards fascistic authoritarianism, backed by
      a bipartisan consensus in the US congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this desperate situation, socialists have a duty to try to win this new
      generation of activists to a perspective that can actually achieve
      liberation. And while the conditions in Palestine make the development of
      popular resistance extraordinarily difficult, the heroism of the Great
      March of Return of 2018–19 indicates that Palestinian aspirations for a
      just future remain unextinguished. More than twelve months of continuous
      mass protests served to unify Gaza in an unprecedented way, led by
      independent activists who imposed a vision of collective struggle that
      harks back to the glory days of the First Intifada. In the context of a
      regional counter-revolution, this inspirational campaign failed to receive
      the practical and political solidarity that it both needed and deserved.
      Yet the movement highlighted one means by which the Palestinians can
      organise themselves to resist the occupation, and in the process reimpose
      themselves on the political imagination of progressives across the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, the Palestinians, like workers and the poor the world over,
      <a id="_Hlk164957480"></a>need to develop a new revolutionary movement
      that can challenge the stifling, decades-long domination of bourgeois
      nationalists in Fatah and Hamas.
