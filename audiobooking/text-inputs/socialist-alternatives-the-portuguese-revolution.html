      Fifty years ago, the Portuguese Revolution represented the climax of the
      radical 1960s and 1970s. In Portugal the working class confronted the
      questions of taking state power, ending exploitation and oppression by
      emancipating itself and initiating a socialist transformation of society.
      This amazing proletarian revolutionary process has not been equalled in
      the struggles since. Yet unfortunately it remains virtually unknown or
      ignored, with little recognition even within the radical left, which under
      reactionary climate has drifted away from the questions of
      self-emancipation, working-class revolution, insurrection and the conquest
      of power. These questions, fundamental to liberation, were posed in
      Portugal under modern conditions, and provide important judgements for
      revolutionary theory and practice. This brief introductory sketch of a
      revolutionary class struggle of nineteen months is limited to only a few
      of the major events.
    </p>
    <p>
      My assessment of the revolution comes from personal experiences and
      interactions with workers and soldiers, meetings with workers’ and
      residents’ commissions, occupied farms, factories under workers’ control,
      and prominent revolutionaries from many political tendencies during the
      revolutionary and counter-revolutionary periods, as well as numerous
      reports by comrades who took part in the events in Portugal. The
      International Socialists were allied and worked with the Party of the
      Revolutionary Proletariat (PRP), the leading proponents of the
      Revolutionary Councils of Workers, Soldiers and Sailors (CRTSM in
      Portuguese), and of a state based on autonomous organs of workers’
      democracy. They were an inspiration, and for all their strengths and
      weaknesses, remain a creative model for revolutionary functioning in the
      midst of revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived in Portugal in July 1975, eager to see the revolution
      first-hand, yet unaware I would witness the “Hot Summer”, the onset of the
      struggle for state power. On the bus from the airport into Lisbon I was
      amazed as every wall was covered with revolutionary posters, and even more
      so as we passed factory after factory with red flags flying over them and
      signs proclaiming: “This factory is under the control of the workers’
      commission”. My mind echoed George Orwell’s words from
      <em>Homage to Catalonia</em>, as he entered Barcelona in 1936: “It was the
      first time I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the
      saddle… There was much of this that I did not understand…but I recognized
      it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for”. It is in this
      spirit that I convey my account of the revolution.

    <h2>Portugal in Africa</h2>
    <p>
      The Portuguese Revolution began on 25 April 1974, when 400 junior
      officers, organised as the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), carried out a
      military coup. The rebels met virtually no resistance as they toppled a
      48-year-old fascist dictatorship, and had no idea that they were
      unleashing a proletarian revolutionary process that would push far beyond
      the limited goals they had set out to accomplish. It would be another
      confirmation of Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution – the idea that a
      bourgeois democratic political revolution can transform uninterruptedly
      into a socialist revolution, with class struggle driving workers to
      realise their goals by attempting to take power. It was a complex process,
      at times confused, but it was in the direction of socialist revolution
      that the working class moved.

    <p>
      The Portuguese Revolution began in Africa. The revolution developed as the
      culmination of years-long opposition to Portugal’s African colonial wars,
      both domestically and in the colonies themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portugal was regarded as a serious world power – despite being a small,
      poor country of 9 million – because of its huge African empire in Angola,
      Mozambique and Guinea Bissau. Together these colonial possessions totalled
      22 times the size of Portugal, with extraordinary natural resources (oil,
      diamonds, coal, coffee and more) and were key to the holding of southern
      Africa for the West and its allies, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South
      Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portugal was the first European nation to colonise Africa in the fifteenth
      century, and it was “the last to leave”. It launched the transatlantic
      African slave trade as a source for primitive capital accumulation, and to
      create a forced labour supply for the sugar plantations in Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portugal’s empire slowly evolved to more modern imperialist practices,
      forcing the colonies to export raw materials to Portugal at below world
      market rates and to be a captive market for higher-priced Portuguese
      exports of finished goods. But this arrangement was limited: while more
      advanced capitalist nations in the post-World War II period moved to
      neocolonialism, backward Portuguese capitalism, dependent on the colonies
      for capital accumulation, continued to maintain direct colonial control.
      Portugal’s fascist regime feared that if it moved to a more limited form
      of economic domination over its colonies, Portuguese capital could find
      itself supplanted by its more developed rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the regime could not hold back historical tides. When most of Africa
      gained political independence, the Portuguese colonies rebelled. In Angola
      a national liberation movement arose in 1961, followed within two years by
      movements in Mozambique and Guinea Bissau.<sup

    <h2>The Portuguese Army</h2>
    <p>
      The new provisional government, the Junta of National Salvation, which
      came to power in Portugal in 1974, was based on an unstable alliance
      between the MFA’s insurgent junior officers and the armed forces’ General
      Staff led by General Spínola, which represented the interests of capital.
      The Portuguese bourgeoisie, facing anti-colonial struggles abroad and
      opposition to the colonial wars at home, finally opted to attempt a
      neocolonial solution: local autonomy for the colonies within a Portuguese
      federation. In contrast, the MFA was for the right of self-determination
      for the colonies, whose national liberation movements would not settle for
      anything less than independence. These divergent interests manifested as a
      power struggle within the military, and became a dynamic for a deepening
      revolutionary progression, similar to that of the February 1917 Russian
      Revolution. In both Russia and Portugal, a democratic government replaced
      a dictatorship because of popular opposition to an ongoing imperialist
      war. The still-dominant ruling class in each country tried to continue the
      war for modified imperialist aims, while the workers, who have no
      imperialist interests, shifted to ever more radical alternatives to
      finally end the wars. Workers refused to accept democratic imperialism as
      a substitute for fascist imperialism; they were not just for ending the
      colonial wars but for the end of colonialism. This intertwining of class
      struggle with anti-imperialism became one of the most impressive
      attributes of the Portuguese revolutionary working class, whose strong,
      ardent anti-imperialism remains an inspiration for international
      socialism.<sup

      The weight, over more than a decade, of Portugal’s simultaneous fight
      against three wars of national liberation, transformed every aspect of
      Portuguese society, and ended in revolution. Portugal was armed by its
      NATO allies, with its officers trained in the US in Vietnam War-era
      doctrines – of strategic hamlets, napalm, direct bombing, body counts,
      civilian massacres, of “dirty wars”. These imperialist policies were as
      disastrous for Portugal as they were for the US in Vietnam. By the late
      1960s, it was clear that Portugal’s position was hopeless; its endless
      wars were lost. Anti-war opposition had also convinced conscious workers
      that Portugal itself was both a part of and controlled by international
      imperialism, and functioned as a semi-colony of the advanced capitalist
      countries.<sup

      Throughout the long wars and economic crisis, working-class consciousness
      developed. As a result of the colonial wars the Army underwent a social
      explosion, expanding from 10,000 men to 220,000. The soldiers drafted were
      workers and peasants. They experienced terrible treatment in an
      institution riddled with rotten class prejudice; were paid an unbelievably
      low wage starting at $6 dollars a month; and were fed in separate,
      inferior messes. The mandatory two-year draft service was extended to four
      years, with up to 24 months of overseas combat in the colonies. To avoid
      military service around 200,000 draft dodgers and 25,000 deserters fled
      the country; by 1973, 20 percent of yearly draftees did not show up at
      induction. Together these figures comprised a significant number of young
      men in their twenties.<sup

      The officer corps grew to 7,000, of whom only 2,000 were professional
      officers, recruited from lower middle-class backgrounds. The other 5,000
      officers were <em>milicianos</em>, recently-drafted university students.
      There were only 14,000 university students in Portugal, children of the
      upper middle class, in a country where only 4 percent of working class
      students could afford to go to high school. University students were
      automatically made officers when drafted. Many of them had taken part in
      the radical left student activity of the 1960s, influenced by the student
      radicalism of the American anti-Vietnam War movement and the Paris May
      1968 uprising. Many spread their radical views to their professional
      officer colleagues, the base of the MFA.<sup

    <h2>Workers radicalise</h2>
    <p>
      Half of the government budget went to the wars, in a country with the
      lowest wages in Europe, virtually no social welfare, and appalling levels
      of illiteracy, disease, life expectancy, maternal and infant mortality.
      Almost a million and a half workers, peasants and ex-servicemen, seeking
      to escape poverty wages, emigrated during the wars, mainly to Western
      Europe. Eight hundred thousand of them were concentrated in the Paris
      region, the “second largest Portuguese city”, many of them radicalised as
      participants in the general strikes and factory occupations of May 1968.
      They marched in demonstrations with banners proclaiming: “Death to
      Salazar, Franco and fascism”. Many rushed home after 25 April 1974 to take
      part in the revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the global economic crisis, runaway inflation, and the
      international working-class upsurge that began in the late 1960s was
      already also shifting Portugal’s workers to the left. By the early 1970s,
      Portugal had yearly inflation rates of 20, 30 and 40 percent. Although
      strikes were banned by the fascist unions, inflation is the mother of all
      strikes; illegal strikes broke out at the end of 1960s, and continued to
      grow. In 1973, there were a hundred and fifty illegal strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most strikes were crushed by the PIDE, the secret political police that
      had been set up and trained originally by the Gestapo. Later, when
      Portugal was incorporated into NATO, the PIDE received training in the
      United States by the CIA. PIDE agents were placed in the large factories,
      usually paid for by the owners. When strikes broke out, workers were
      fingered by the PIDE, and by foremen, management and some working-class
      spies. At TAP, for example, the national airline with 8,000 employees,
      underground cells – of the Communist Party, the Movement of the Socialist
      Left (MES) and the PRP – existed alongside 200 PIDE informers. In the last
      years of the dictatorship, strike leaders were routinely arrested,
      tortured and jailed in prisons and concentration camps.<sup

      But the movement kept growing and radicalising.
    </p>
    <h2>The revolution begins</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the drafted soldiers and many of the junior officers became
      politically influenced by the national liberation movements they were sent
      to fight. They came to realise that they had been sent to fight people
      like themselves, politically oppressed and impoverished. They were
      horrified at being forced to fight for the control of a social system, and
      for the ownership of vast colonial natural resources, by the six great
      monopolies that dominated the Portuguese economy and were allied with the
      fascist regime. Over time, they started to take seriously the
      anti-colonial injunction issued by the African liberation movements to
      form a fourth national liberation movement in Portugal itself. And it was
      the ultimate success of the wars for national liberation that finally
      destroyed the corrupt fascist regime in Portugal and opened the space for
      the workers’ revolution that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many draftees and junior officers came to believe that the wars were
      hopeless, that victory was impossible and Portugal was already defeated.
      As opposition to the war grew, the government in June 1973 called a
      “Combatants Conference” to mobilise the army to regain support for the
      wars. A group of junior officers circulated a petition stating that the
      Conference decisions did not apply to them since they had been excluded
      from taking part. Hundreds of officers signed the petition, a high level
      of support that convinced the initiators to organise a meeting of officers
      who opposed the war, which became the MFA. Within a few months, this group
      of junior officers grew to 400. They were politically diverse, ranging
      from unpolitical, to conservative, to the left. By their second meeting,
      they came to the decision that the only way to end the wars was to
      overthrow their own government. The rest of the officers were uncommitted
      or more conservative, passive on 25 April, but supporters of the MFA so
      long as it was ending the colonial wars. They also decided to passively
      follow the MFA because of the unexpected strength of the civilian mass
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MFA was politically diverse, but from the start its leadership bodies
      were dominated by the broad left, including its eight-person coordinating
      committee, and its three-person executive committee. The program of the
      MFA was written by Ernesto Melo Antunes, a Marxist and self-described
      Gramscian, and it called for “decolonization, democracy, and development,”
      with a heavy emphasis on anti-monopoly and pro-working-class measures.<sup

    <p>
      The MFA’s 1974 military coup lifted the lid on a volatile situation and
      the working class exploded. On the very first day, masses awakened to the
      possibilities of open, legal struggle. Tens of thousands of workers took
      to the streets, cheering on the army as it entered Lisbon. The clandestine
      resistance movements, the Communist Party and the revolutionary left, came
      up out of the underground within hours, and started organising people on
      the streets. Thousands marched singing the <em>Internationale</em>.
      Resistance fighters led masses of people to the prisons, demanding the
      release of all political prisoners, many of whom had been strikers. The
      government capitulated within a day, freeing all political prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the order to free political prisoners was extended to
      thousands of African prisoners in the colonies. Meanwhile, revolutionary
      students led thousands of people to the Lisbon airport to demand that no
      troops be sent out to the African colonial wars. The new government
      refused to accept that demand, but the next day granted amnesty to all
      draft dodgers and deserters. On the streets, in the factories and in
      government offices throughout Lisbon, workers sought to hunt and lynch
      members of the secret police. The government stepped in to protect the
      PIDE agents from their long-suffering victims, but abolished the secret
      police, and arrested hundreds of them that day. In response to the stormy
      upheaval from below, the government was making the first of what was to be
      many concessions to militant working-class action, and everyone felt that.
      In turn, the power of the mass movement demoralised the agents of
      repression, the regular police and the national guard, who, fearful for
      their lives, refused to go out onto the streets The forces of law and
      order disappeared for a period of time.<sup

      The new government then declared May Day a national holiday. From 25 April
      to 1 May, most workplaces and all the schools were closed. For 47 years
      May Day rallies had been illegal and had led to clashes with the police.
      Now, 600,000 people demonstrated in Lisbon, a city of just one million
      people. The rally was addressed by the Junta, the MFA, Mário Soares of the
      Socialist Party, and Álvaro Cunhal of the Communist Party. Political
      consciousness, developed by the years of war and economic crisis, soared
      overnight as May Day awakened many workers to the depth of support for a
      socialist transformation. Few, however, understood what a socialist
      transformation entailed or how one could occur.<sup

    <p>
      Political engagement and sophistication had been impossible for most
      people, but now, with the lid lifted, the masses were awakening with every
      variety of radical ideas on offer. Political discussion broke out
      everywhere, in the bars, cafés and workplaces, on the buses and on the
      streets. Consciousness was transformed by enormous leaps, and ferment was
      everywhere. Daily life became dominated by strikes, demonstrations,
      occupations and meetings, endless meetings, setting masses into motion.
      Working-class consciousness was further stimulated by the liberation of
      the media, the newspapers, radio and TV, as fascist owners of media
      enterprises were driven out, and the press and TV were opened up to all
      the left-wing groups that had emerged, further stimulating political
      dialogue, as participants in the struggle read and debated the competing
      proposals of various left forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 2 May, the schools and the factories reopened. Revolutionary groups
      took over the universities, abolished exams and fired all deans, heads of
      universities, and fascist collaborators among professors and
      administrators. High school students held general assemblies and demanded
      that all teachers with ties with fascism be fired and that attendance
      records be abolished so students could take part in political
      demonstrations.<sup

    <h2>The Workers’ Commissions</h2>
    <p>
      But the greatest transformation of class consciousness took place in the
      factories. Assemblies were held as all who worked for wages – manual,
      skilled, technical, office, and often lower management – met together. All
      questions of working life and politics were now open for discussion.
      Workers started discussing all conditions of their employment: wages, wage
      differentials, length of the working day and working week, mandatory
      overtime, harassment, sexism, poor working conditions, as well as broader
      debates over capitalism, exploitation and imperialism. The assemblies
      would then draw up lists of the workers’ demands, unleashing struggles for
      immediate improvements of conditions. Factory assemblies during the
      revolutionary period usually met on a weekly basis in the hours after
      work, with sub-groups assigned to working on specific topics met more
      frequently. In a few working-class strongholds, like the Lisbon Naval
      Yards (Lisnave), assemblies met bi-weekly during paid work time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assemblies elected factory committees, in Portugal called workers’
      commissions, Comissão de Trabalhadores (CTs). Factory assemblies and CTs
      were the first independent workers’ organisations formed. The existing
      fascist unions were not independent, they were state-controlled labour
      fronts. The assemblies and the CTs started the self-organisation of the
      working class, and were the basic organs of workers’ democracy.<sup

    <p>
      Workers’ commissions were the organisations which the working class
      recognised as their own. They became the core of workers’ power, the locus
      of the class struggle, the organs of workers’ control, the mobilisers for
      mass demonstrations, the nucleus for popular power, the most distinct
      feature of the Portuguese revolution. Representatives to the workers’
      commissions were elected in the workplaces by the factory assemblies, or
      by different sections of the factory. In the large factories CT members
      were full-time representatives, akin to shop stewards. Their term was
      usually for a year but they were subject to immediate recall, and made no
      more than a worker’s salary. It is no accident that this followed the
      guidelines of Lenin’s <em>State and Revolution</em>, which was number two
      or three on Portugal’s best-seller list for the next eighteen months,
      running only somewhat ahead of Lenin’s <em>Imperialism</em> (at number six
      or seven).
    </p>
    <p>
      Within three or four months the number of workers’ commissions grew to
      between 2–4,000. The most politically advanced were in the 50 large
      factories with over 1,000 workers. The largest, most modern factories
      contained the most militant and class-conscious workers, the vanguard of
      the revolution, many of them veterans of the colonial wars. These skilled
      workers, particularly at workplaces like Lisnave, Setnave, TAP, Siderurgia
      and Efacec, were part of the international economy. Many militant strikes
      were carried out by poorly paid, unskilled, assembly, agriculture and
      building workers. But the skilled workers at the largest factories were
      the best-paid and most self-confident. They were the most needed by the
      international corporations, the most secure in their position in the
      economy, and the least afraid of losing their jobs. Often such conscious
      workers had a history of involvement in political struggles under fascism,
      within cells of the underground organisations, or as participants in the
      illegal strikes prior to 1974.<sup

    <p>
      The Communist Party, the only well-organised political force in Portugal,
      initially decided to boycott the workers’ commissions, but felt forced to
      join them nine months later, in February 1975. The CP was antagonistic to
      the workers’ commissions, which they feared as rivals to the trade unions
      that they now controlled. Almost all Portuguese trade unions had been
      fascist-controlled, with a dozen or more craft unions in a single
      workplace. These unions were not allowed to strike or hold democratic
      elections. Immediately after the overthrow of the dictatorship, the
      Communist Party occupied the fascist trade union offices, tossed out the
      officials, and took the unions over from the top down, with no elections
      and no input from workers. The CP thereby controlled almost all the trade
      unions in the country, which they used as leverage for influence and power
      in the new government. The CP used similar tactics to take over local
      government authorities, occupying government offices, replacing the
      fascist officials with their own members, and preventing local
      elections.<sup

    <p>
      Both the Spínolist wing of the Junta and the MFA agreed that the CP had to
      be in the cabinet in order to control the working class and the mass
      movement. This proved to be an inaccurate evaluation of working-class
      forces. The absence of the CP, thanks to their Stalinist sectarian
      blindness, opened the workers’ commissions and – with them the mass
      movement – to much more radical leadership direction, and action. When the
      CP was forced to flip-flop and enter the CTs in February, 1975, the CTs
      became an ongoing battleground between the CP and the revolutionary left,
      with the CP forced to take more left-wing positions that put them at odds
      with their coalition partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CP’s original boycott of the CTs left a healthy legacy of suspicion
      and hostility towards the party, and allowed for the development of
      rank-and-file-based democratic internal life that included discussion,
      decisions and resulting actions, unlike the situation within the trade
      unions and other CP-dominated groups. The workers’ commissions were the
      organised force that prevented the CP from controlling the working class,
      and opened up space for the revolutionary left.<sup

    <h2>The strike wave</h2>
    <p>
      The Portuguese working class entered the revolution as an active
      participant in the making of history, becoming a class-for-itself, and
      altering the politics and class goals of the MFA coup. The first stage of
      the revolution was a mass strike wave, the most basic proletarian method
      of struggle. In revolutionary periods, strikes deepen the political
      consciousness of both participants and observers. In Portugal, led by the
      workers’ commissions, 400 hundred strikes rocked the country in the first
      two months of the revolution, May and June of 1974. Many of those strikes
      united economic and political demands, a quality Rosa Luxemburg explained
      as the essence of the mass strike.<sup

    <p>
      Most strike demands were for wages, the reinstatement of workers fired
      during the illegal strikes, and <em>saneamento</em>.
      <em>Saneamento</em> meant purging the workplaces of all fascist
      collaborators: owners, foremen, managers, executives, even working-class
      stool pigeons. Fascist supervisors were often locked out or chased out of
      factories, and in a few cases expelled, during the first factory
      occupations. In some plants where purging forced out all the foremen,
      workers began to decide who the foremen were, or simply run things
      themselves, with good results. <em>Saneamento</em>, when carried out by
      workers themselves, and not the state, created the first ideas of workers’
      control that would become powerful in the next stage of the revolution.
      Through the assemblies and <em>saneamento</em>, the CTs were becoming a
      dual power in the workplaces, challenging bosses’ control over
      production.<sup

    <p>
      The strike wave’s economic emphasis was on wages and salaries. In the
      first four months of 1974, inflation in Portugal was running at 63
      percent. Many strikes demanded a doubling of wages for striking workers
      and often, a doubling of the minimum wage. Some strikes were for creating
      greater working-class equality by reducing wage differentials. At Lisnave,
      there were 11 different pay grades, and the strike aimed to raise all
      workers to the highest pay grade. The Communist Party and its unions
      opposed all 400 strikes and actually attempted to break some of them. The
      assumptions of the Junta, the MFA and the CP – that the CP and its unions
      could act as a disciplinary agent of the government and control the
      working class – were a complete failure. The CP claimed that higher wages
      were irresponsible, unrealistic and threatened the stability of the new
      government, which could lead to the return of fascism. The CP, prior to
      joining the government, had called for a minimum monthly wage of 6000
      escudos ($240), and then supported the Junta proposal for 3300 escudos
      ($132), which workers called “the wage of misery”, further antagonising
      militant workers, who felt betrayed by the CP.<sup

    <h2>The Communist Party</h2>
    <p>
      During the revolution, the Portuguese far left was the strongest in the
      world. Every radical tendency existed and was tested by the actuality of
      revolutionary practice; most failed miserably. With the bourgeois parties
      tainted by their fascist collaboration, politics flowed through the MFA,
      left parties and popular power organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Communist Party was the only large, well-organised political party at
      the start of the revolution. The CP had been the underground party of
      resistance to fascism; many of its members had been tortured and jailed
      for years. The CP’s bravery and consistent fight against fascism gave it
      enormous prestige and respect in the working class, which it regularly
      betrayed. The CP was an unreformed Stalinist Party that never deviated
      from Moscow’s line, and was capable of overnight shifts between incredible
      sectarianism and fantastic opportunism. Its sole consistency was to oppose
      every revolt from below, including strikes, factory occupations, housing
      take-overs and workers’ control. The CP viewed the power and passion of
      the mass movement as a threat to its manoeuvres from above. Put simply, as
      the largest party of the working class, the CP also functioned as the main
      barrier to socialist revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CP emerged from the underground with 5,000 members. With a vigorous
      open recruitment campaign at Lisnave and other factories, it grew within
      months to 100,000 members. Many radical groups, the PRP included, missed
      early opportunities, and were handicapped by continuing the underground
      organising culture limited to strict cadre recruitment. CP membership
      dwarfed the combined membership of all the left groups, and allowed it to
      build a massive bureaucratic apparatus of thousands of paid full-timers,
      union and local government officials and organisers. This made it a
      formidable opponent in the factories, holding back working-class militancy
      and advancement.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref18"

              class="reference-body-link"
              >18</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When the CP opposed the workers’ committees and the strike wave, many
      party members and sympathisers left and joined the Maoists, second-rate
      Stalinists whose ideology and perspectives were closest to the ideas they
      had received through CP education. Some others joined revolutionary left
      groups, but many became <em>apartido</em>, or non-party. This was a strong
      current that appeared in the working class, distrusting the CP and all
      other political parties, reinforced by the sectarian operations of certain
      left groups which put their organisation’s interests over those of the
      working class. Many of the best revolutionary militant workers were
      <em>apartido</em>, the strength of which most revolutionary groups had to
      accommodate to at demonstrations and joint actions, but which held back
      necessary party-building.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CP’s political strategy throughout the revolution was to attach itself
      to MFA officers and to give unwavering support to the MFA and its
      decisions. CP strength in the MFA increased with the almost accidental
      appointment of Vasco Gonçalves, who was considered no threat by President
      Spínola, as prime minister. Gonçalves had been, and possibly was still, a
      member of the CP; even if not, he acted as a disciplined supporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communist Party theory maintained that Portuguese capitalism was not
      developed enough for socialism, and therefore the party was against a
      workers’ revolution. Instead it advocated for collaboration with the
      middle classes and even sections of capital against the monopolies and
      fascism. The CP supported a two-stage revolution plan: for the foreseeable
      future, a democratic revolution for national independence and development,
      followed in the distant future by a socialist revolution. This was
      orthodoxy in Communist Parties after the Stalinisation of the Comintern.
    </p>
    <h2>The Socialist Party</h2>
    <p>
      The other main party in the various provisional governments that emerged
      during the revolution was the Socialist Party. The Portuguese SP was
      formed in Bonn in 1973, under the auspices of the German Social Democratic
      Party, with 200 middle-class members, including professionals, lawyers,
      journalists, professors and intellectuals. It gained massive electoral
      support from workers, but in the factories it was smaller than the
      revolutionary left. To gain this support, it initially took positions
      verbally to the left of the CP, supporting the mass strike wave and
      calling for workers’ control and overthrowing capitalism. As the workers
      radicalised and increasingly imposed power from below, the SP snapped back
      to its petty-bourgeois origins, opposed workers’ power, and became
      financed by the CIA as the single most important force in the bourgeois
      counter-revolution.<sup

    </p>
    <h2>The Maoists</h2>
    <p>
      Portugal’s revolutionary left was the largest in the world. Many dozens of
      far-left groups suddenly emerged or formed. They represented, and put to
      the test, every conceivable shade of radical ideas, riddled with
      confusions and problems. They also contributed to the fragmentation of the
      left, and in the sorting-out process of the next year there were a dozen
      survivors. Most left groups had no independent role, but politically
      tailed after or tried to influence the CP or SP. Four radical groups – the
      PRP, the MES and the Maoist Movement to Reorganise the Party of the
      Proletariat (MRPP) and Popular Democratic Union (UDP) – were at times real
      forces in the military and the working class, particularly in the CTs,
      with influence in the revolutionary process. Maoism, however, was a
      political disaster for the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MRPP was initially the largest revolutionary organisation and played a
      very militant, albeit sectarian, role in the early strike wave.
      Unreconstructed Stalinists, they disgraced themselves with their dogmatic
      adherence to China’s line that the CP was social-fascist, its ties to
      Moscow representing a greater danger than the capitalists. This led the
      MRPP to an early alliance with the SP against the CP, and later the MRPP
      became a useful instrument for the right. The MRPP joined the reactionary
      physical assaults on CP offices and members, and supported the
      counter-revolutionary coup of 25 November 1975. As the MRPP discredited
      itself, the UDP, formed through the merger of over a dozen small Maoist
      groups, became the main Maoist organisation. The UDP shared the CP’s
      two-stage theory, opposed socialist revolution as unrealistic, originally
      considered workers’ control to be utopian and anarchist, and argued that
      revolution was premature until a new, real Communist Party was built.
      Their main programmatic demand for struggle was for national independence.
      The UDP grew primarily by positioning itself as the most militant group in
      actions, even when that led to ultra-left positions. UDP membership was
      double or triple that of the PRP, which made them a major competitor for
      influence and support from the most radical workers and soldiers. The UDP
      was forced at times to cooperate in joint work with the PRP and other
      revolutionaries, but they were always prepared to engage in treacherous
      manoeuvres for sectarian raids of popular organisations, for their real
      objective of building the Reconstructed Marxist-Leninist Communist
      Party.<sup

    <h2>The PRP – party building in the revolution</h2>
    <p>
      A proletarian revolution requires two necessary entities to be successful:
      workers’ councils (soviets), as the governmental bodies for a workers’
      state; and a revolutionary workers’ party that provides political
      leadership during each stage of the revolution to move it forward, with
      the goal of winning the working class to the conquest of state power. The
      Portuguese Revolution began with neither of these two essentials and after
      19 months it only had rudiments of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most difficult task revolutionaries can face is to build a
      revolutionary workers’ party from scratch in the midst of revolution
      itself. The absence of a mass revolutionary party has been the decisive
      cause of the defeat of many revolutions, including Portugal’s. It is a
      question that will often reappear in the future, given the state of the
      contemporary revolutionary left. Defeat, however, is not inevitable; the
      Hungarian Revolution of 1919 occurred with a Communist Party being formed
      weeks before the revolution, and the defeated 1905 Russian Revolution was
      the dress rehearsal for revolutionary victory in 1917. The lack of a
      revolutionary party at the beginning of revolution is not an excuse to
      fatalistically accept or await defeat. The job of revolutionaries is to
      work as best they can with existing conditions, as they attempt to build a
      revolutionary workers’ party during revolution, however difficult that may
      prove to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only force in Portugal that genuinely worked to build a revolutionary
      workers’ party was the Revolutionary Party of the Proletariat (PRP), an
      organisation that stood uncompromisingly for revolutionary communist
      ideals: for a proletarian socialist revolution, for a state based on
      worker’s councils, for workers’ democracy, for workers’ control of
      production and the state, for opposition to all imperialism, and for an
      armed insurrection for the seizure of state power. It was the only group
      that fought for these ideals in the popular power organisations and in the
      barracks, in an honest, non-sectarian manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PRP began with a small underground cadre of 80, but with enormous
      recognition and prestige for its military operations under fascism. Its
      two most famous accomplishments were blowing up a NATO base outside
      Lisbon, and penetrating the officer corps, stealing the war plans for
      Guinea Bissau and turning them over to the national liberation movement.
      It had also controlled the underground Radio Free Portugal, which operated
      from Algiers and had broadcast news every night into Portugal that
      sustained the resistance. With legality, the PRP quickly drew in hundreds
      of its existing sympathisers. During the revolution it grew to 3,000
      members, with 150 factory cells in the Lisbon industrial belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PRP originated as a faction in the CP in 1969, opposing both the
      Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia and Stalinism. It rejected the
      two-stage theory of revolution and proposed that a proletarian socialist
      revolution was on the agenda in Portugal. It had opposed CP passivity and
      advocated for armed struggle against the fascist regime. Its main strength
      was that it was linked to militants in the most important factories in
      Marinha Grande and the Lisbon-Setúbal industrial belt, whose assessment of
      working-class consciousness informed the PRP’s perspectives and ability to
      make rapid shifts in the turbulence of the revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an interventionist organisation the PRP was unequalled in the
      international revolutionary movement of the 1970s, but its weakest point
      was theory. PRP ideology was an eclectic mixture of Lenin, third worldism,
      Guevara, Luxemburg and Trotsky. They refused to be labelled as followers
      of any of them. From Trotsky, they took three important theories:
      permanent revolution, the united front against fascism, and the revolution
      betrayed. They considered the Stalinist states to be state-capitalist
      class societies, but had illusions about the progressive character of
      “third world socialism”. But on the most important question of theory and
      practice, that of the working class, they were excellent, with total
      commitment to the working class, its interests, its independence, and to
      learning from its struggles. They believed in and fought for workers’
      power, for the self-organisation and self-activity of the working class,
      for the necessity of both a revolutionary party and autonomous
      organisations of the working class. Implementing these views, whatever
      other theoretical weakness the PRP had, placed them head and shoulders
      above much of the international left.
    </p>
    <p>
      A powerful advantage of the PRP was their cohesive functioning on the
      basis of shared political analysis, through a unique method unlike any
      other revolutionary group internationally. In the rapidly changing
      conditions of the revolution, they regularly produced extremely
      sophisticated analyses of all social, economic and political events, of
      the evolving role of the political parties, of shifting consciousness
      among the working class and soldiers, and drawing conclusions for what was
      to be done. PRP membership cohesion and discipline was based on these
      perspectives and the organisation went over each new analysis individually
      with every cadre and member, which provided them the basis for functioning
      in the mass movement. These analyses were also shared with sympathisers in
      the CTs, the residents’ commissions (CMs) and among soldiers and officers
      of the Continental Operations Command (COPCON), who were dependent on them
      to function through the chaotic shifts in the revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite its small size, the PRP was the most influential group in shaping
      the ideology and political initiatives of the revolutionary left. Central
      to major turning points in the revolution were key initiatives that the
      PRP proposed to advance the revolution at critical moments: the
      Inter-Empresas, CRTSMs, the COPCON document, United Revolutionary Front
      (FUR), Soldiers United for Victory (SUV), and the Setúbal Committee of
      Struggle, all of which will be discussed later.<sup

    <h2>Tensions in the Junta</h2>
    <p>
      The government that came to power after 25 April, the Junta, was a
      coalition of the MFA army officers, the bourgeoisie, the Socialist Party
      and the Communist Party. The main bourgeois goals were twofold. First, a
      transition to bourgeois democracy to allow for Portugal’s entry and
      integration into the European Economic Community (the predecessor of the
      European Union). This would allow for exports from Portugal’s low-wage
      economy to the Common Market without tariffs or restrictions and to
      attract foreign investment for modernisation and development. The second
      main bourgeois goal was ending the colonial wars on a platform of partial
      local self-government within a Portuguese federation, with Portuguese
      control of defence and foreign policy. This would protect Portuguese
      companies’ dominant position in the colonial economies. These goals were
      stymied however, by the strength of the mass movement. Despite SP and CP
      support, they could not contain the working-class revolt, nor the revolt
      against the colonial wars, spearheaded by the troops and the MFA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month after the MFA coup, the troops in Guinea Bissau mutinied and
      demanded that the government grant independence to the national liberation
      movement. In August police fired upon mass demonstrations in Lisbon,
      demanding independence for Mozambique, killing one and wounding others;
      but the state was incapable of suppressing growing working-class
      opposition to colonialism. The bourgeoisie was determined to prevent the
      loss of Angola, its most important colony, with the richest natural
      resources and greatest potential wealth. There were other imperialist
      considerations; on 19 June, Spínola met with President Richard Nixon who
      promised American support, with the proviso that the right to independence
      of Angola and Mozambique would not be recognised, to which Spínola
      completely agreed.<sup

        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <h2>COPCON</h2>
    <p>
      As the strike wave mounted, it became clear that the government was
      incapable of simply suppressing the movement because the apparatus of
      state repression was in disarray. The secret police had been abolished.
      Both the regular police and riot police often refused to go on the street
      or near the strikes for fear of the working class. The government solution
      was to create a new organ of state repression, the Continental Operations
      Command (COPCON), to serve as the military police of the Lisbon region.
      That proved to be yet another cruel illusion for the bourgeoisie – COPCON
      would soon evolve as the main army support for the popular power movement
      and the revolutionary left.
    </p>
    <p>
      COPCON originally had a dual function. It was designed to change the
      balance between the Junta and the MFA. COPCON was to be the MFA’s power
      base in the army, out of Spínola’s control, charged with overseeing
      government implementation of the MFA program. COPCON’s other function was
      to hold down workers’ strikes and housing occupations by mediation, and
      coming to agreement with the workers involved, so that the popular forces
      whose support the MFA wanted were not totally antagonised. COPCON operated
      by those guidelines for a few months, and broke some important strikes in
      the name of law and order.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref23"

              class="reference-body-link"
              >23</a
            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      But over time the body changed and was radicalised by proletarian struggle
      – and its own working-class soldiers. The COPCON troops who tried
      mediation, arbitration and compromise increasingly ended up identifying
      with the workers, their demands and actions. A significant turning point
      was the demonstration at the Lisbon Naval Yard (Lisnave), Portugal’s
      largest and most important factory. The demonstration demanded the
      <em>saneamento</em> of the remaining fascist collaborators in the Lisnave
      administration, as well as expressing opposition to the new government
      strike law, supported by the CP and SP, which banned factory occupations,
      political and sympathy strikes, and sought to severely limit strike action
      across the board, while legalising employer lock-outs. The Lisnave
      demonstration was banned by the government and opposed by the CP cells
      operating in the factory, but supported by the factory assembly and
      workers’ commission. As Lisnave workers began to start the march to Lisbon
      carrying banners reading “Death to Capitalism”, COPCON troops who had been
      sent with loaded rifles to prevent the march began fraternising with the
      workers. They responded by chanting at them: “Sons of the working class.
      Brother Workers. Future Workers. Always, always on the side of the people”
      and “The People, Armed and United, Will Never Be Defeated”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faced with such a scene, working-class soldiers broke down, some crying,
      and put down their guns. For the first time in the revolution, troops had
      refused to be used against the workers. Officers understood they could not
      force the troops to stop the march, and so withdrew them. This turning
      point began a period in which the government could not rely on COPCON as
      its repressive apparatus against workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander of COPCON was Otelo de Carvalho (Otelo to everyone in
      Portugal), the hero of the victory over fascism. His background was that
      of a fairly apolitical, naïve officer, devoted to the military, and
      perceived as a political lightweight. Yet he was a brilliant military
      strategist. Otelo was the organiser and architect of the 25 April coup,
      who had successfully executed every detail of the complex plan. When
      COPCON moved to the left, Otelo became the most popular figure in
      Portugal. He and many troops under COPCON’s command became radicalised,
      sympathetic to the revolutionary left, and often served as the armed
      strength of the popular power movement. Otelo remained politically
      unsophisticated and often erratic: loyal to the military and its officer
      corps, which included initial opposition to the rank-and-file Soldiers
      United for Victory. But he was also led, as he said, by the “spontaneity
      and creativity of the masses which gives them the ability to solve their
      own problems”, to become a revolutionary defender of soviet power and of
      arming the working class.<sup

    <h2>The coup of 8 September 1974</h2>
    <p>
      The culminating impact of all these events – the mass strike wave, the
      factory commissions, the revolt of the troops in Guinea Bissau, the
      growing shift of power to the MFA, the unreliability of COPCON, and the
      coalition of the Junta and the MFA being ripped apart by the radicalism of
      the class struggle – convinced the bourgeoisie that they had lost control
      over the democratic revolution. Their solution was to plan a coup to
      restore their authority, halting the process of decolonisation and
      democratisation from below. Spínola, supported by right-wing parties that
      were little more than reorganised fascist groups, called on “the silent
      majority” to march on Lisbon on 28 September 1974, patterned after
      Mussolini’s march on Rome. The plotters were confident their coup would
      succeed, as they took over key army bases and re-established control over
      the major sources of information, the newspapers, television and radio
      stations. They preemptively arrested Otelo and other left-wing officers to
      avert military resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The working class sprang into action to prevent the coup from succeeding.
      The Communist Party and the trade unions finally took action, calling on
      railroad workers and bus drivers to halt all transport into Lisbon.
      Workers, along with the PRP and other armed revolutionaries, built
      barricades around Lisbon, and COPCON troops joined them to prevent
      right-wingers from entering the city. The right-wing coup was defeated by
      this combination of spontaneous actions by the working class and the
      revolutionary left, with the strike calls of the CP and the unions. The
      march was called off. The Spínola government collapsed, replaced by the
      rule of the MFA without the General Staff, and the balance of forces
      shifted sharply to the left.<sup

    <h2>Factory occupations</h2>
    <p>
      28 September was a turning point for the revolution, opening the second,
      more radical phase, with a rise in class struggle and growing opposition
      to the capitalist system. The right-wing coup plotters were leading
      figures from the old order, a fact that convinced the left that fascism
      had not yet been fully eradicated. While the fascist superstructure had
      been eliminated, the economic, social and political forces that were the
      base for fascism remained intact and could reassert their power. All the
      gains of the revolution could be lost, and the fear of arrest and prison
      radicalised both MFA officers and working-class cadres. The working class,
      having broken out of the prison of fascism, now broke with the prison of
      capitalist politics as well. All the neofascist parties, which compromised
      the bulk of the capitalist parties, were now banned. Well-dressed people,
      luxury cars, exclusive shops, and expensive restaurants disappeared from
      the streets and public view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radical second stage of revolution, with its greater class
      polarisation, introduced new revolutionary proletarian methods, including
      the occupation of the factories, and the beginning of workers’ control of
      production. As the working-class revolution progressed, so did the
      counter-revolution, with each class engaged in dynamics of
      self-protection. As workers became more confident, combative and
      insistent, the owners grew frightened that they could lose everything.
      Having failed in their coup attempt, the capitalists tried more economic
      methods of protecting their property and wealth. These included economic
      sabotage, laying off workers, cutting work to part-time, closing or
      threatening to close the factories, and removing equipment from the
      factory. The bosses began a capital strike, ending investments for new
      machinery and refusing the money needed to replace or repair worn-out,
      damaged or obsolete machinery. The multinationals cancelled orders and
      shifted production to plants in other countries. The six great Portuguese
      monopolies used the banks they owned to transfer money out of the country
      – which was revealed by the bank workers’ union when they opened the
      books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such polarising measures are intrinsic to the logic of capitalism during
      proletarian revolutions in general, not only to Portugal’s. In
      working-class revolutions, as capital engages in economic sabotage to
      protect their wealth, class struggle is forced to shift and workers must
      create new methods of self-defence. Workers moved from strikes over wages
      and conditions to the struggle for the right to work and defence of their
      jobs. They started occupying the factories to prevent them from being
      closed. They demanded that the books be opened and called for
      worker-control of company finances, so that the money to keep the plant
      functioning didn’t simply disappear. As this occurred, factory assemblies
      and workers’ commissions drew the conclusion that to maintain their
      employment, they had to control the workplace. To control the managers,
      they started democratically electing their own foremen. When workers
      realised that they had to control production, or else the factory would go
      bankrupt and they would lose their jobs, they begin the process of
      establishing workers’ control inside the factories. This began to take
      place in Portugal in the autumn of 1974.<sup

    <h2>Housing occupations</h2>
    <p>
      Complementary to factory occupations were the occupations of housing which
      had begun in April but accelerated after the failed coup. Tenants and
      shanty town dwellers formed neighbourhood residents’ commissions,
      <em>comissão de moraderes</em> (CM), which were patterned after the
      workers’ commissions of the factories, with assemblies and elections of
      representatives who were all recallable. Together the CMs and CTs formed
      the core of the popular power movement, and militants were often active in
      both.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred thousand members of Lisbon’s working class resided in shanty
      towns on the outskirts of the city, living in tin huts lacking running
      water and indoor toilets. Such conditions produced horrendous health
      problems. To cite just one example, one of every twenty infants died
      before their first birthday. The shanty town dwellers, along with tenants
      of other terrible housing, moved into empty apartments and challenged the
      right of landlords to maintain a large quantity of unoccupied housing for
      purposes of speculation. They defended the housing occupations with the
      slogan: “As long as there are people without houses, there should not be
      houses without people”. During the revolution some 80,000 people in Lisbon
      moved into occupied housing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MFA, SP and CP were against the housing occupations. They defended the
      property rights of the landlords, arguing that they were for maintaining a
      coalition with the petty bourgeoisie, not losing its support. COPCON
      troops were the exception, as they supported the “illegal” occupations,
      and later enforced the occupations as legal. Armed COPCON troops selected
      places for workers to occupy, physically defending them against the
      owners. This further divided COPCON from the MFA and the coalition
      parties, increased the split within the armed forces and further enhanced
      the image of COPCON and Otelo. The CMs also fought against the landlords
      to freeze rents, as well as for determining fair rents of what workers
      could afford based on their salaries and family sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the CP and SP were against occupations, the neighbourhood committees
      became heavily influenced – even more than the CTs – by revolutionary
      militants from the PRP, UDP, the League of Revolutionary Unity and Action
      (LUAR) and MES. The CMs became mobilising forces for the revolutionary
      demonstrations of the Hot Summer of 1975. Since the occupations were
      illegal under capitalist law, they appealed to the newly-forming Popular
      Justice Courts. The CMs raised the slogan “A revolutionary situation
      demands a revolutionary legality”. They did not recognise the capitalist
      laws, including the fascist constitution of March 1933 that was still in
      effect. What they were doing, they stated, was acting in accordance with
      legality for the working class, establishing revolutionary justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a second failed coup in March, these occupations would spread to
      vacant houses, mansions and luxury hotels. The neighbourhood commissions
      took charge of these buildings and turned them into medical clinics,
      child-care centres, senior centres, libraries, workers’ clubs, canteens
      and laundries, as well as providing for other social needs. Workers who
      ran these social centres felt an enormous sense of liberation, pride and
      accomplishment.<sup

    <h2>Inter-Empresas and land occupations</h2>
    <p>
      All of these revolutionary actions divided the MFA government and
      political parties while increasing the size and influence of the radical
      left. In February 1975, a mass demonstration against unemployment, for the
      right to work, would become pivotal to the shifting political alliances.
      The demonstration was called by the Inter-Empresas, a coordinating
      committee of 37 workers’ commissions, and represented one of the first
      attempts to link the CTs across individual factories for unified
      working-class support of strikes and occupations. PRP members were key
      initiators of this attempt to unify the CTs. The Inter-Empresas called for
      a mass demonstration against unemployment on 7 February. At the same time,
      NATO was aggressively holding exercises off Lisbon’s harbour as a warning
      that it could intervene against the revolution. Fearing NATO, the CP and
      SP opposed the right-to-work demonstration as overly provocative, and the
      government decided to ban it. The workers’ commissions were not
      intimidated, and in response the demonstration added the second demand of
      “NATO Out, National Independence”. The Inter-Empresas met with and won the
      support of COPCON, which then had the MFA Assembly overturn the ban on the
      demonstration. Thirty thousand workers turned out triumphantly, backed by
      the same revolutionary groups that would later that summer form the United
      Revolutionary Front (FUR). For the first time, the MFA had broken with the
      CP and SP to support radicals from the popular power movement. All the
      political forces understood this as a political opening to the left, and
      recognised that the existing government coalition could not last.<sup

    <p>
      Joining with the working-class movement in the factories and
      neighbourhoods, the farm workers of the south began occupying the huge
      agricultural estates. These farms, many of them spread over thousands of
      acres, were owned by the old nobility and were often kept uncultivated as
      hunting grounds. The agrarian proletariat, reliant on seasonal work, was
      the most exploited and poorly paid sector of the working class. And as a
      result, many farmworkers were radical communists. In 1962, under fascism,
      200,000 farmworkers, led by the Communist Party, had carried out a general
      strike and won the eight-hour day. During the revolution, the farmworker
      occupations occurred under the banner of “land to those who work it”. The
      workers did not break up the estates to divide the land; instead they
      reorganised the farms as co-ops and collective farms. The farmworkers were
      given government credit for tractors and machines to increase the food
      supply and overcome Portugal’s heavy dependence on food imports. In some
      places, links were made between the farms and neighbourhood commissions,
      bringing food to urban workers at lower prices. Many farmworkers from the
      south regularly came into Lisbon on trucks and tractors to take part in
      the revolutionary demonstrations.<sup

    <h2>March 1975: Another botched coup</h2>
    <p>
      The encroachment of popular power on the social relations and legal system
      of capitalism, the mass occupations of factories and housing and the
      revolt of troops who refused to go to Angola all convinced leading
      capitalists to gamble on a second military conspiracy. This coup was
      planned by General Spínola along with senior army officers, leading
      industrialists and owners of the six great monopolies and the banks, all
      of whom were convinced that repression could bring popular compliance. It
      was an even bigger failure than the first failed coup, technically
      incompetent and politically misjudged to an extraordinary degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coup began by seeking vengeance on the Light Artillery Regiment
      (RALIS), one of the most revolutionary of the COPCON forces, who would
      later become famous when they dropped the required military oath to the
      country, instead swearing allegiance to the working-class revolution. The
      RALIS barracks were shelled and bombed, killing one and wounding a dozen
      enlisted men. Right-wing paratroopers were sent into battle to gain the
      surrender of RALIS. Instead, when they were surrounded by thousands of
      enraged workers, they went over to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response, impromptu mobilisations of workers spread everywhere. A
      general strike of virtually all factories opposed the coup. Workers rushed
      to known left-wing barracks and demanded guns. Armed workers then began to
      patrol the streets. Masses of workers surrounded barracks thought to be
      sympathetic to the right, and soldiers arrested right-wing officers. The
      coup plotters did not receive the military backing they had expected from
      Spínolist military supporters, who later that day were expelled from the
      MFA. COPCON moved to organise the military defence of Lisbon and was
      decisive in defeating the coup. Workers’ barricades went up throughout
      Lisbon, and were reinforced by armed revolutionaries from the PRP and
      LUAR, as well as COPCON troops. For days workers ran the city. The coup
      collapsed almost before it started, and many capitalists involved with it
      fled the country, abandoning their factories, while others, including
      owners of the six monopolies, were arrested. The MFA Assembly and its
      Council of the Revolution now had full control of state power.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      But this could not be the revolution’s final resting point. The class
      struggle went right through the MFA, splitting it into factions that
      represented different social forces and their political proposals.
    </p>
    <h2>Nationalisations</h2>
    <p>
      On the day of the coup, militant bank workers and their unions occupied
      the banks, arrested the managers and prevented all attempts to withdraw
      money or transfer it abroad. They opened the books and exposed how the
      banks, owned by the six great monopolies, had been subsidising the right
      wing, organising economic sabotage and stealing from the people and the
      government. In one case they revealed that the owners of the Espirito
      Santo bank had stolen two billion dollars from government subsidy funds
      for job protection and transferred the funds out of the country. The bank
      workers declared that they would occupy the banks until the they were
      nationalised under workers’ control. The next day, the government
      nationalised all of the nation’s domestic banks and insurance companies,
      which together owned one quarter of national industry. This was a dramatic
      reversal of its economic plan released just one month earlier, and
      reflected the enormous impact of the popular revolt against the coup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nationalisations were carried out without compensation to the owners,
      which for capital was a declaration of total war. At other times and in
      other countries, social democratic governments have carried out
      nationalisations, but always with compensation, which preserves the wealth
      and social power of the capitalist class. But this massive confiscation of
      private capitalist wealth placed the MFA and the revolutionary masses into
      direct conflict with the capitalist system.<sup

          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      In response, domestic and international capitalism united to crush the
      revolution economically and politically. Their aim was to create chaos and
      hunger. An economic blockade by the European Community (EC) and
      international capitalism began to try to starve Portugal into submission.
      Orders to Portugal were cancelled, or not renewed. Tariffs were placed on
      Portuguese goods. The EC reduced imports from Portugal and blocked it from
      accessing credit. Foreign direct investments and all international aid and
      subsidies to Portugal were ended; they would not be restored until after
      the final, successful right-wing coup. At the same time, the CIA now
      stepped up its preparations for a third counter-revolutionary coup.<sup

    <h2>Workers’ control</h2>
    <p>
      The 11 March coup marked another stage in the revolutionary process; an
      intensification of class warfare, of factory land and housing occupations
      – and the beginning of dual power. Factories whose owners had fled, or
      been expropriated, came under workers’ control. In other factories,
      strikes broke out demanding nationalisation under workers’ control as a
      pre-emptive measure. These strikes demanded financial backing from the
      government in order to maintain production and employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May there were strikes for workers’ control at the major factories of
      TAP, CUF (the largest monopoly), CTT (postal and telephone), as well as at
      <em>República</em>, one of the newspapers that supported the Socialist
      Party, and Rádio Renascença, owned by the Catholic Church. Troops were
      sent in to break the strikes, but in every case, the troops went over to
      the strikers, shifting the MFA Assembly leftwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As political workplaces, <em>República</em> and Rádio Renascença became
      the flashpoints for the fight over workers’ control. The SP, when it left
      the government in July, used <em>República</em> as an excuse, claiming
      that it was the work of the CP attempting to end press freedom as a step
      toward establishing a Stalinist state. Despite this, most workers
      understood that the SP was out to crush workers’ control as an idea.<sup

      Hundreds of factories were under workers’ control, with the workers’
      commissions supervising the administration. Still, it was an uneven
      process. In more backward factories, the old administrative or technical
      staff often ran the factory. In the large, advanced factories, the workers
      and the CTs organised production, set the hours of work, wages and
      salaries, replaced piece-rates with fixed salaries, ended dangerous and
      unsafe working conditions, determined line speed, health and safety
      measures, and supervised technical personnel. In some workplaces, they
      raised wages for the lowest paid, froze higher wages, and moved to
      implement equal pay for women workers. It was an inspiration for every
      visiting socialist to experience workers’ control – the hallmark of every
      great proletarian revolution – alive in 400 factories in Portugal. Now
      working for themselves, the workers humanised working conditions, and
      simultaneously raised productivity by drawing upon the organising genius
      that exists in the working class. Workers understood the productive
      process better than foremen and administrators; they knew how to increase
      production if the ends would benefit them, not the bosses.<sup

      The workers’ commissions’ primary objective was to keep the factory
      running in order to pay the wages of the workforce. Firms under worker
      control were faced with difficult decisions about how to finance the plant
      and market its products, pay bills and prevent bankruptcy. They needed to
      gain orders, replace materials and machinery and find markets for their
      products. Factories under workers’ control, where there was
      self-management, were still regulated by the capitalist market, and would
      remain so as long as capitalism persisted. Workers’ control is necessary
      for socialism, but not sufficient. Without workers taking state power and
      instituting a planned economy, self-managed factories become co-ops in a
      capitalist economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many CTs quickly realised this, and did not want to be in the position of
      exploiting themselves, cutting labour costs in order to sell on the
      capitalist market. They therefore recognised the need for national
      planning under workers’ control. But such an approach – that is, the
      development of a socialist economy that can meet its potential as a force
      for humane, creative work – can only come about by workers taking state
      power. In the Portuguese Revolution, this was not simply a desirable
      socialist goal, but a necessity that could not be postponed. It was
      workers’ control that forced open the debate on state power and placed it
      on the immediate agenda.<sup

    <h2>Dual power</h2>
    <p>
      Dual power is usually presented in terms of two political powers, and the
      struggle between them. But at a sufficient scale and Portuguese level of
      militancy, workers’ control can introduce an economic dual power to the
      capitalist market, in which one side or the other must triumph and bring
      the struggle to conclusion fairly rapidly. Workers’ control and the
      capitalist market are the representatives of the two incompatible social
      systems of capitalism and socialism. The capitalist market will force
      occupied workplaces to compete on the market, subjecting workers to the
      laws of capitalist competition. In contrast, under workers’ control,
      production is not carried out for profit and accumulation, the fundamental
      dynamic of capitalist production. These two systems were in a deadly
      competition in which one or the other must destroy its adversary. The
      intense Hot Summer was the dramatic expression of this life-or-death
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Portugal, while dual power had developed in the factories, farms and
      neighbourhoods, there were still no working-class political bodies that
      could pose an alternative to the political power of the state. Without
      this, the working class had no way of making political decisions – let
      alone governing – on local or national questions. Factory commissions were
      not sufficient to respond to Portuguese the economic sabotage engineered
      by capital, end the colonial wars, deal with the crises in health,
      education, pensions, social welfare and more. There was no alternative to
      the existing state and its policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this, during the revolution, dual power in Portugal was often
      humorously derided as dual powerlessness. The government was incapable of
      enforcing its decisions. This situation reached a climax in November
      during the building workers’ strike, when the government announced that it
      was itself “on strike” because it lacked the power to enforce any of its
      decisions. But there was no working-class alternative government lying in
      wait to fill this vacuum.
    </p>
    <p>
      This impasse was a part of the chronic political crisis during the long
      Hot Summer, as the third stage of the revolution emerged: an advanced
      revolutionary situation where the central question was deciding which
      class would hold state power.<sup

    <h2>Revolutionary councils</h2>
    <p>
      The first proposal for workers to take power had arisen shortly after the
      failed coup of 11 March, when the PRP proposed the formation of a state
      based on revolutionary councils of workers, soldiers and sailors (CRTSMs).
      This proposal was launched through the workers’ commissions of Marinha
      Grande, where the PRP held a majority of the city’s CTs. Marinha Grande, a
      small city of 40,000 that was centre of the glass-blowing industry, had a
      legendary reputation. Its workers had risen against fascism in 1934 and
      had set up a soviet republic, although it was subsequently crushed. Now
      its workers were issuing the call for a new soviet republic across all of
      Portugal. The CRTSMs became the first in a series of proposals on state
      power that were to follow and that would split the MFA. Discussions in
      workers’ commissions and army units in some of the most important
      factories and radical barracks provided support for the CRTSMs. In
      mid-April, a founding conference of the CRTSMs was held, with
      representatives from over 200 workers commissions and 40 military units.
      It was an encouraging start, one that could not be ignored, and led to
      debates in many workplaces and military units, and within the MFA
      Assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first CRTSM public event was a Lisbon demonstration on 17 June, that
      helped propel the subject of state power to a central position in public
      debate for the next five months. This demonstration was co-sponsored by
      the workers’ commissions of Lisnave and Setnave and the PRP and called for
      workers’ power and the defence of workers’ control at
      <em>República</em> and Rádio Renascença, both of which were under attack
      by the SP and Catholic Church respectively. The demonstration of 40,000
      workers was led by ten thousand shipyard workers from Lisnave and Setnave.
      They carried banners calling for all power to the working class, for a
      state based on workers’ councils, and for the dictatorship of the
      proletariat. They also raised a slogan that became a favourite chant at
      many Hot Summer demonstrations: “Fora com a canalha, o poder a quem
      trabalha” – Out with the scum, power to those who work (the ruling class
      often referred to the “lower classes” as “canalha”).<sup

    </p>
    <h2>The MFA splits</h2>
    <p>
      The MFA Assembly met the next day and came out against the dictatorship of
      the proletariat. Meanwhile COPCON officers, most notably Otelo de
      Carvalho, endorsed the CRTSMs. In an indication of the influence of the
      radical left, Otelo stated that councils and neighbourhood committees were
      the essence of the Portuguese revolution, and were like soviets that
      existed in Russia in 1917 before the bureaucracy set up a new class
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the weeks that followed, the MFA split into three factions, politically
      broadly represented by the SP, CP and revolutionary left. Each faction
      made a proposal to solve the crisis of dual power, through reconstructing
      political, state and economic power. The three groups mobilised their
      supporters to battle it out in what was called the Hot Summer, which
      continued until the coup of 25 November.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Socialist Party and its collaborators inside the MFA, led by Ernesto
      Melo Antunes, drafted a proposal called the Document of the Nine, which
      was signed by 400 officers. It was for parliamentary democracy, and
      opposed the radicalism of the popular power movement as an obstacle to
      “real” democracy. It was for resolving the economic crisis of dual power
      by joining the European Economic Community and accepting the dictates of
      the capitalist market. It charged the Communist Party with trying to
      destroy the free press and democracy and attempting to set up a state
      modelled on Russia and Eastern Europe. The Nine’s main enemy, however, was
      the revolutionary left and workers’ councils. It attacked the radicalism
      of what it dismissed as a wild revolutionary vanguard confined to Lisbon
      and the south; considered workers’ control to be anarchist; and argued
      that military discipline had to be restored in the barracks, where the
      troops, in its view, were out of control.<sup

    </p>
    <p>
      The Communist Party, and its allied Gonçalvist officers, proposed a state
      based on Committees in Defence of the Revolution (CDR). Their blueprint
      was for political power to rest with the MFA and its government, with
      decisions made from above, but coordinated with tightly controlled popular
      mobilisations from below. Their model was based on the Cuban state. The
      Castro government tried behind the scenes to convince radical leftists
      estranged from the CP to support the CDR proposal. This had some influence
      on the MES. PRP members, by contrast, shed their illusions in Castroism as
      they began to understand what it meant in practice, and what its meaning
      was if applied to the Portuguese working class and to themselves. The CDR
      plan to resolve the economic crisis was the Battle for Production, for
      workers’ control to be co-managed with supervisors and local government
      authorities in order to increase production through voluntarism, gutting
      real workers’ control. These bureaucratic proposals that tried to straddle
      and avoid firm decisions on dual power had limited appeal beyond the
      CP.<sup

    <p>
      COPCON presented the third alternative, that of the revolutionary left,
      for a state based upon the popular power organisations – the workers’ and
      neighbourhood commissions, farmworkers’ co-ops and barrack units. The
      COPCON document denounced both the CP’s attempt to control the state
      apparatus and the social democratic Document of the Nine as hostile to
      popular power and a way of keeping the means of production in the hands of
      the bourgeoise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The COPCON document was written by COPCON officers (primarily from the
      PRP, with input from officers from the UDP and MES as well) and by Isabel
      do Carmo (General Secretary of the PRP). The PRP explained that the COPCON
      document was a compromise since it maintained the MFA and the MFA-Peoples
      Alliance. This was not the same, they said, as soviet power, but would
      hopefully be a transition towards it. The idea was that if implemented,
      this set-up would Gonçalves be given the content by the working class that
      would quickly lead to a soviet state. The economic emphasis of the COPCON
      document was for the extension of workers’ control to the entire economy,
      while developing economic self-sufficiency and trade with the third world
      in order to break from the “imperialist” market.<sup

    <h2>The Hot Summer</h2>
    <p>
      By the Hot Summer, which continued into November, the MFA was moving to
      the right as the three factions struggled for power. The summer featured
      mass mobilisations, demonstrations, strikes, occupations, dramatic battles
      over <em>República</em> and Rádio Renascença, and clashes between military
      units. Demonstrations in Lisbon were the largest since the first May Day,
      with tens and hundreds of thousands participating. In the working-class
      quarters, in all the cafés, bars, neighbourhood clubs, subways, buses,
      even at soccer games, people were talking and arguing about the meaning of
      each of the three political programs, the strength of the contending
      forces, and what could be done to take power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revolutionary left was being forced to act together as a more united
      force. This was given urgency by the question of state power and their
      shared support for the COPCON document, as well as the threat of the right
      within the MFA and the reactionary riots in the north of Portugal. The PRP
      proposed and organised a united front, the United Revolutionary Front
      (FUR), with the other revolutionary left groups: LUAR, MES, LCI, and the
      Popular Socialist Front (FSP), with the occasional support of the UDP. The
      FUR became the organising centre for the mass demonstrations and activity
      in support of the COPCON document and in defence of workers’ control at
      <em>República</em> and Rádio Renascença. As the united alternative to the
      CP and SP, the FUR gave the revolutionary left the ability to win many
      workers, neighbourhood commissions, farmworkers, co-ops and radical
      soldiers to its proposals and demonstrations. As a whole, the groups in
      the FUR functioned as greater than the sum of their parts; a unified
      revolutionary left that was recognised as a serious contender for power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FUR and the UDP, with the support of 250 workers’ and neighbourhood
      commissions, called the first demonstration in support of the COPCON
      document, which attracted, 120,000 workers, soldiers and sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the two great weakness of the revolution remained: the absence of
      soviets and of a mass revolutionary workers’ party. The PRP, despite its
      remarkable and creative achievements, was still a small party of a few
      thousand, and therefore not a credible alternative to the major parties.
      The FUR was an attempt to bridge this gap, but was a coalition, not a
      revolutionary party. The FUR’s cohesion would be challenged by sharp
      political differences, sometimes over minor points. These inevitably
      required negotiations to resolve, limiting the FUR’s ability to make rapid
      sharp shifts, or to function as a disciplined body. The coalition was
      necessary to defend the revolution from the growing right, and to advance
      the revolution as the alternative to social democracy and the CP. But it
      was not the force that could arm and politically prepare the working class
      for a revolutionary uprising, an armed insurrection and a possible civil
      war.<sup

      The prospect of a civil war was being foreshadowed as the north of the
      country was rocked by armed right-wing mobs that attacked 100 offices of
      the CP and left groups, burning them down, and beating and shooting those
      on the scene, leaving some dead in their wake. These attacks were
      supported by the right, the SP, the Catholic Church and the Maoist MRPP
      and PCP-ml. The PRP was the only group to shoot back when armed mobs
      attacked its headquarters in the north.<sup

    <h2>Soldiers United for Victory</h2>
    <p>
      As the MFA officers shifted to the right, their bonds with working-class
      troops grew increasingly strained and broken. This led to a growing
      soldiers’ revolt, characterised by insubordination, the collapse of
      military discipline, the creation of an underground soldiers’ press,
      outright mutiny, and finally the formation of a united revolutionary
      organisation in the barracks, Soldiers United for Victory (SUV).
    </p>
    <p>
      SUV began in the Oporto area in the north, which had been the first place
      right-wing officers had taken over the MFA in the summer of 1975. The
      northern region MFA defended the right-wing mobs and replaced General
      Eurico Corvacho, the Gonçalvist commander of the north, with a
      right-winger who then purged left-wing soldiers and officers. An
      underground meeting of hundreds of soldiers took place in August to defend
      Corvacho and the expelled soldiers. That meeting was quickly followed by
      the founding of SUV, the largest rank-and-file soldiers’ organisation
      since the Russian Revolution. SUV was organised by soldiers from the PRP,
      UDP, MES, the Internationalist Communist League (LCI) and LUAR, the same
      groups that supported the COPCON document. For the first time, soldiers
      from these groups created a joint organisation in the army, moved by the
      bursting of illusions in the MFA as it shifted to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      At SUV’s first public appearance, a press conference on 7 September, they
      announced their program and purpose: to organise inside the army, to
      defend left-wing soldiers, to democratise the army and to end MFA rule.
      SUV identified themselves as workers in uniform, and raised working-class
      demands for better conditions, better pay, a single mess with officers’
      food, and free transport for soldiers (trips home often took the whole
      month’s pay). Their manifesto charged that a reactionary offensive was
      underway in and out of the barracks, and that the MFA was now in the
      service of the counter-revolution. SUV raised as its slogans:
      “Reactionaries Out of the Barracks” and “Soldiers are Always on the Side
      of the People”.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUV’s vision for a democratic army involved mass assemblies and the
      elections of recallable soldiers’ committees. They sought to link these
      soldiers’ committees with workers’ and neighbourhood commissions, with the
      goal of strengthening the Popular Assemblies. They were against all
      imperialisms. They viewed themselves as the armed wing of the working
      class, in struggle with all workers for the destruction of the MFA and the
      bourgeois army, for the creation of a revolutionary army of the working
      class. SUV was the reflection and intensification of dual power, now also
      inside the military.<sup

    </p>
    <p>
      The working class immediately rallied around SUV, as the hoped-for defence
      against the right-wing offensive. Workers’ support for SUV rapidly led to
      mass demonstrations. On 10 September, three days after the appearance of
      SUV, 40,000 workers, alongside 2,000 soldiers, demonstrated in Oporto. The
      next day, in Lisbon, 33 military units took part in the SUV demonstration.
      The SUV demos were the biggest ever held in Portugal’s provincial cities.
      One of the most sensational demonstrations of the Hot Summer was the
      united FUR and SUV demonstration of 120,000 people in Lisbon on 25
      September, in defence of jailed SUV members, with thousands of soldiers
      making up the largest military presence ever at a demo. Masses of workers
      and soldiers then seized the city buses, driving them to the military jail
      outside Lisbon where they forced the authorities to free the political
      prisoners.<sup

      >
    </p>
    <h2>Soviets and guns</h2>
    <p>
      Also on 7 September, the same day as SUV’s public appearance, left-wing
      units of the military police revolted and refused to be sent to Angola.
      Then on September 10, Captain Álvaro Fernandes, an Angolan PRP officer and
      one of the authors of the COPCON document, went underground after turning
      over 1,500 G-3 automatic weapons to the PRP and workers’ commissions.
      Otelo publicly defended this action, saying: “The guns are in good hands”.
      (At the same time, however, Otelo was also denouncing SUV, since it called
      for the destruction of the MFA and the bourgeois army, which reflected
      Otelo’s confused loyalties over dual power.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, the workers’ commission at Lisnave was already armed, and
      the PRP was forming armed worker militias in other factories. These events
      were creating an insurrectionary mood inside the working class. The PRP
      then made its famous announcement that the working class should arm itself
      to prepare for an insurrection, which, they argued, was the only road to
      prevent civil war.<sup

      In September, the first soviets appeared, but there were only two of them.
      One was located in the city of Marinha Grande, the stronghold of the PRP
      mentioned earlier. The second soviet was a broader, more representative
      council of dual power that appeared in Setúbal at the end of September. It
      called itself the Committee of Struggle of Setúbal, and was formed under
      the initiative and influence of the PRP cells in the city’s factories. It
      had representatives from Setnave and most of the city’s workers
      commissions, from the neighbourhood commissions and from all the army
      units in Setúbal. The Setúbal newspaper placed itself in support of the
      Committee of Struggle, publicising its events, decisions and actions. The
      Committee was so popular that it drew in the periphery of the Communist
      Party, which forced the CP itself to support it. It was a workers’
      council, a dual power in the city of Setúbal, which served as a governing
      power, enforcing rent control, supporting occupations and mass
      demonstrations, supervising the city government, and more. It called
      itself a committee of struggle, rather than a council, because its
      objective was to struggle for a working-class seizure of power.<sup

    <p>
      Another promising development was the strengthening of a few Popular
      Assemblies in some parts of Lisbon. The Assemblies came out of an earlier
      MFA proposal to coordinate neighbourhood committees, workers’ commissions
      and soldiers’ units with local authorities, as functioning local
      governments. The Popular Assemblies were against the right and for defence
      of the revolution, but were highly uneven politically and often lacked
      political clarity. They had been set up by, and were loyal to, the MFA,
      and were paralysed as the MFA became an instrument of the right. Some of
      the better Popular Assemblies were potential nuclei of workers’ councils,
      had the revolution continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the centre-right bloc gained a majority within the MFA, the
      government fell. The new, sixth provisional government represented a
      drastic shift to the right. It was dominated by the SP and the Group of
      Nine, with Vasco Gonçalves dismissed and CP influence curtailed. In an
      attempt to regain power, the CP then moved dramatically to the left,
      aiming to increase and use its popular support as a bargaining chip in
      negotiations with the SP and MFA. The CP now took some positions similar
      to those of the revolutionary left, blocking the continued growth of the
      revolutionary left, and shifting some working-class support back to the
      CP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since both the CP and the revolutionary left were battling the same
      SP-MFA-Right bloc, cooperation occurred among their supporters, who came
      out for each other’s demonstrations, without official co-sponsorship.
      Sharp political differences persisted which limited joint activity. But
      the CP was a mass force that was now making radical statements, supporting
      radical actions, and verbally flirting with the popular power movement.
      For some worker supporters of the FUR, the CP was seen as a lesser evil
      than the social democrats. The CP had led the building workers’ strike,
      the most radical strike of the period, that barricaded the presidential
      palace and held the cabinet and the parliament as hostages. The CP’s
      flirtation with radicalism convinced many workers that the CP was the
      necessary force to defend the revolution, defeat the right and open the
      road to state power. This belief was an understandable illusion, but an
      illusion nonetheless. As the CP manipulated the workers’ and popular power
      movement in order to negotiate the terms of its return to the government
      with the SP and the MFA, it remained the major barrier to the working
      class taking power.
    </p>
    <h2>The coup of 25 November 1975</h2>
    <p>
      All of these developments came to a climax with a third, successful, coup
      on 25 November. Officers associated with the CP, under the impression that
      the CP supported their action, started the motions for a peculiarly
      amateurish attempted coup, which in turn was the signal for the successful
      joint social democratic and-right-wing coup that would end the
      revolutionary situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start of these competing coups, the CP pulled the plug, abandoning
      its military supporters and imposing discipline on its trade unions to
      block all attempts to strike or mobilise against the right. At a meeting
      the night before, the CP’s leader, Cunhal, had come to an agreement with
      Melo Antunes, the organiser of the next day’s coup. The details of that
      meeting have never been made public. But on 26 November, Melo Antunes went
      on television to defend the CP from charges of plotting a coup, and to
      prevent any measures against the CP. Melo Antunes argued that including
      the CP in the government was necessary to defend democratic stability. The
      deal perhaps had been for the CP to tolerate a social democratic coup as a
      lesser evil than a right-wing coup. For Melo Antunes, the real danger was
      not the CP, but what he referred to as the Lisbon Commune, after the Paris
      Commune of 1871. It was the revolutionary left, and the PRP in particular,
      that would be slandered with coup-plotting and repressed.<sup

    </p>
    <p>
      The coup of 25 November was not the right-wing coup that had been
      expected. Until then, the revolutionary left, as well as most other
      political forces, had thought a new coup would mean the return of fascism,
      or some facsimile of fascism. The chant at left demonstrations had been
      “Portugal will not become the Chile of Europe”, in reference to the
      CIA-backed coup that had overthrown the left-wing government of Salvador
      Allende and installed the Pinochet dictatorship just two years earlier.
      But the 25 November coup in Portugal was to be carried out by the social
      democratic centre of the MFA, albeit with right-wing support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key players in the coup, besides Melo Antunes, were Frank Carlucci,
      Mário Soares and António Ramalho Eanes. Carlucci, a sophisticated
      imperialist, was the US Ambassador and a CIA agent, who would later be
      promoted to second-in-command of the CIA. Carlucci had been secretly
      organising for a social democratic coup for over a year, convinced that
      after two failed right-wing attempts, a similar third one had no better
      prospects for popular support and success. He was convinced that a Chilean
      solution in Portugal would only bring on civil war, with the final outcome
      uncertain. Instead he hoped that a social democratic solution and entry
      into the Common Market would stabilise Portugal as a capitalist country in
      the Western bloc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlucci’s main agent and co-thinker was Mário Soares of the SP. Carlucci
      arranged for substantial CIA funding of the Socialist Party as the logical
      organiser of popular forces for a coup. The CIA’s large monthly financing
      of SP activity was laundered through the German Social Democratic Party
      and British Labour Party. Thus international social democracy maintained
      its historical record of backing counter-revolutionary violence .
    </p>
    <p>
      Melo Antunes and the MFA reformers would not finalise coup preparations
      until after Angolan Independence on 11 November, for fear that if the
      right-wing won the coup, they would continue the colonial wars. Melo
      Antunes was the MFA’s house intellectual: a self-described Marxist and
      Gramscian, author of the MFA’s major programmatic documents, and the
      leader of the MFA majority and Group of Nine. He was a left social
      democrat, who supported the educated elite implementing reforms for the
      masses, as long as the masses did not take matters into their own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramalho Eanes, the other main figure in the coup, organised the military
      operations. Eanes had one foot in each camp – the Group of Nine, all of
      whose meetings he attended, and the centre-right. He became the main
      beneficiary of the coup, becoming president of the Republic the following
      year. His operational troops were the right-wing Amadora commandos led by
      the far-right Jaime Neves, whose role Eanes had kept secret from the Group
      of Nine.<sup

    <h2>Social democratic counter-revolution</h2>
    <p>
      Social democratic repression differs from right-wing repression. In
      Portugal, social democratic piecemeal “reform” tactics were used over a
      period of years to restore full capitalist functioning, with a tempo
      designed to avoid violent working-class resistance. The immediate action
      was to crush what it viewed as its most dangerous enemies, the
      revolutionary left in the military. On the day of the coup, COPCON was
      abolished and Otelo arrested. Radical units were then purged, reorganised
      or dissolved. Restoring army discipline was the first step to restoring
      state repression over society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step was to restore disciplined functioning in the state
      apparatus. Revolutionary groups were persecuted, the PRP more than any
      other, with 100 members jailed, and arrests continuing for years. The two
      main leaders of the PRP, Isabel do Carmo and Carlos Antunes, later
      received long jail terms; meanwhile, Spínola and right-wing coup plotters
      were welcomed home from exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, it took a few years for the state to gain the confidence to crack
      down on the factory committees and on workers’ control, often through
      financial pressure. Workers’ control had come into existence to defend
      employment; now, to maintain jobs it was forced to accept management
      control. It took more years still to undo the nationalisations and restore
      them to private ownership, and longer still to give financial compensation
      to the former owners. The government proceeded step by step, in a more
      sophisticated counter-revolutionary process than the traditional
      right-wing counter-revolutionary dictatorship and savage repression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Portuguese revolution ended on 25 November 1975, but many
      revolutionaries did not immediately accept defeat. Revolutionaries are
      trained to always be the last to leave the field of battle, and in some
      past instances, what could seem to be defeats turned out to be only
      temporary setbacks. The immediate revolutionary situation was over, but
      the revolution might have revived, in conjunction with international
      events in Italy, Greece, and most importantly, in Spain. Franco had died
      on 20 November 1975. Until then, there had never been a democratic
      transition away from fascism. As a result, the left expected a revolution
      in Spain, which could then revive the Portuguese revolution. That did not
      occur, thanks to the atrocious politics of the Spanish Communist Party,
      which was desperate to engineer a peaceful transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defeat of the Portuguese Revolution turned out to be the final act of
      the 1960s–’70s radicalism. The neoliberal offensive had begun germinating
      in the 1975 recession. There would be no more reforms for the working
      class, but rather a decades-long attack by capital, with right-wing
      advances and working-class retreats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the Socialist and Communist Parties been for the working class taking
      power, the Portuguese Revolution would not have been defeated. Social
      democracy and Stalinism were responsible for this missed opportunity for
      workers to take power in the heart of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the Portuguese Revolution provides many important lessons for the
      revolutionary left that have been lost owing to the defeat of the
      revolution, and by decades of neoliberal reaction internationally. Those
      lessons are not all that different from those of other great working-class
      revolutions. The most basic is that the coming revolution will be a
      proletarian revolution or there will not be a revolution. Building organs
      of workers’ democracy and dual power is necessary, but not sufficient for
      victory. The revolutionary process is also a process for the
      counter-revolution, and both sides have time constraints. If the
      revolutionary workers do not take state power, the counter-revolution will
      end the revolutionary situation and workers’ democracy will be destroyed.
      Never underestimate reformism. In a revolutionary period, vehicles for
      reformism backed by powerful sponsors can be reinvented overnight as the
      agents of reaction. The indispensable instrument for the working class to
      emancipate itself is its own revolutionary party. The greatest chance for
      successful revolution is to not postpone party building, whose every
      advance now is a bridge to future liberation.
