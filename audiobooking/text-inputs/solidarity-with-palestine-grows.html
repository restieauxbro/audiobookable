      For over six months the Western world has witnessed an unprecedented
      mobilisation against Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza. From New York to
      Paris and Berlin, London to Melbourne, hundreds of thousands have stood up
      against the destruction of the Gaza Strip. This is a mass movement in
      every sense of the word. It has combined enormous central demonstrations
      in major capital cities with myriad local actions. In some places the size
      of the central demonstrations have been comparable with those against the
      Iraq War, despite enjoying little to none of the institutional support
      from mainstream liberal organisations that the latter received.
    </p>
    <p>
      But unlike Iraq, the mobilisations have been regular and sustained, with
      millions of people refusing to go back to business as usual while the
      Western-backed slaughter of Palestinians continues. In many places
      demonstrators have faced severe repression. In France and Germany,
      protests were banned for weeks, before activists managed to defeat
      government attempts at censorship. In Germany in particular, the situation
      is out of control. A progressive conference supported by Yanis Varoufakis,
      former Greek Finance Minister, was raided and shut down by police on
      accusations of anti-Semitism. Police have now taken the extraordinary move
      of banning rally speeches in languages other than English and German, and
      have been arresting rally organisers, including left-wing Jews. All of
      this points to the violent hypocrisy at the heart of Western “democratic”
      values our leaders are so fond of extolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to defend Israel’s atrocities directly, the establishment attack on
      the pro-Palestine movement has relied on accusations of anti-Semitism to
      stifle the movement. Governments and countries that have vilified Muslims,
      refugees and other minorities for decades have suddenly discovered that
      racism exists and can be a problem. Yet instead of confronting bigotry in
      its deeply established and institutionalised forms, especially on the far
      right, it is the anti-war movement that is somehow accused of
      discrimination and harassment. We are through the looking glass, so much
      so that figures of the far right with recorded histories of anti-Semitic
      views have been allowed to argue that migrants are entirely responsible
      for European anti-Semitism. This, in the lands of Vichy, pogroms and the
      Holocaust. Meanwhile the US Congress passed a motion moved by far-right
      Republicans condemning the chant “from the river to the sea” as
      anti-Semitic, after winning the support of the vast majority of Democrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Australia, Zionists released a fake and edited video of protesters in
      Sydney supposedly chanting “gas the Jews”, which was used to argue for a
      blanket ban on future demonstrations. The police eventually admitted the
      footage was doctored, but not before the anti-Semitism narrative had been
      firmly established. Rally organisers in Sydney were correct to both
      distance themselves from any bigotry, while insisting on the democratic
      and anti-racist credentials of the movement, and successfully carried on
      the protests.

    <p>
      In Australia, the weekly protests in a number of cities have been vital
      for maintaining momentum, keeping the issue in the public eye and as an
      entry point for those looking to join the movement. But for a committed
      minority, the desire to do more has propelled them into a series of
      impressive local actions targeting weapons companies, Zionist politicians,
      local councils, and more. In Melbourne the scope of organising is so broad
      that more than six months after the protests began, there are still days
      where there can be four separate solidarity actions taking place. The
      breadth and scale of this organising is inspirational and enormously
      positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      A particular highlight has been the campaigning led by students and youth.
      Late last year socialist high school students initiated walkouts of
      hundreds in cities across Australia, with a peak of 1,000 in Melbourne. At
      the time, this was the biggest school student action in the world. They
      were subsequently joined by university students, who have organised
      strikes, sit-ins and public forums on campuses everywhere. Students have
      played a vital role overseas too. In the US Students for Justice in
      Palestine and Jewish Voices for Peace have led impressive campaigns and
      stood up to serious repression both on and off campus. As we go to print,
      a student occupation of Columbia University in New York has become an
      international sensation, and has inspired similar actions elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of all this organising, support for Palestine has expanded
      beyond the traditional bases of the left and migrant communities.
      Demonstrations in the US have often been instigated by left-wing Jews and
      the broader community. Links with various anti-racist organisations and
      campaigns have been made everywhere. Here in Melbourne, where this journal
      is published, well under half of the attendees at the demonstrations are
      from Arab or Muslim backgrounds. This represents a huge shift from
      previous rounds of mobilisation, and creates a deeper and broader basis
      for ongoing organising into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this is reflected in opinion polls conducted in the West, which
      have been steadily – albeit slowly and unevenly – shifting in favour of
      the Palestinian people. A Gallup poll conducted in the US in March found
      that 55 percent of Americans opposed Israel’s military actions in Gaza,
      while just 36 percent were still in favour. This is an important result,
      given the overwhelmingly pro-Israeli slant of news media there, yet the
      overall picture is that far more people identify as broadly sympathetic
      with Israel than Palestine. Polls are better in the UK, where the number
      of firm supporters of Palestine (28 percent) is double that of firm
      supporters of Israel (14 percent). The caveat, however, is that most
      people are uninformed and uncommitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Australia the situation is similar. On the concrete issues of the war,
      an Essential Poll in March found that 37 percent supported Israel
      withdrawing from Gaza, while just 18 percent thought Israel was justified
      in continuing its attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presumably after Israel’s highly publicised assassination of the seven
      World Central Kitchen aid workers, public opinion will have shifted even
      further. Yet there is a strong strand of isolationism and indifference,
      which would prefer Australia to “not get involved”, even when our
      government and military-industrial complex is actively assisting Israel’s
      war crimes. Thus a Resolve Strategic poll conducted in April found that 57
      percent of Australians thought our government should “take no action” on
      the war on Gaza, up from 45 percent on the same question in November.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importantly, the movement here has also adopted an unusually firm stance
      against the ALP, which has once again disgraced itself by backing Israel
      so firmly. Its initial stance repeated all the talking points of Zionist
      <em>hasbara</em>, supporting Israel’s (non-existent) “right to defend
      itself”. The government also decided to give $75,000 aid packages to each
      and every Australian citizen who happened to be in Israel on October 7,
      but nothing to Australian citizens in Gaza or the West Bank who have
      suffered from Israel’s subsequent brutality. Since then it has attempted
      to speak out of both sides of its mouth to avoid alienating Muslim voters,
      but few have been taken in by this rhetorical tweak. Aside from the
      isolated arguments of a few union officials and left sects, the Palestine
      movement has been clear that Labor is complicit in the genocide until it
      cuts all military and economic ties to the apartheid regime. That they
      refuse to do so is a product of Labor’s long-term commitment to the US
      alliance and the system of imperialism that the Americans oversee.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, Israel’s atrocities and the movement’s response have clearly
      created a new and wider audience for anti-war and anti-imperialist
      politics, particularly in the West. But we cannot be complacent. The lies
      and propaganda of the media and political class retain much of their
      power, even if social media and the radical press gives a minority access
      to alternative perspectives. The solidarity movement cannot be satisfied
      with current mobilisation numbers and retreat into a bubble, but must
      continue reaching out to try to connect with new audiences by linking up
      with different issues and other movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, this is something of a debate. In the typically
      declamatory style of online discussions, there has been an observable
      tendency to denounce those who have only recently become aware of Israel’s
      criminal policies. But rather than moralistically dismissing such people,
      the campaign needs to keep reaching out and expanding our capacity to
      influence, educate and mobilise. This means welcoming those who are new to
      the cause, and trying to consolidate and deepen their commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also political debates, especially around forces in the Middle
      East that are cynically using the Palestinian cause to build their
      popularity. For instance, some in the movement have fallen into the trap
      of championing Iran, the Houthis or Hezbollah as allies of the Palestinian
      people. This is a profound mistake: the enemies of our enemies are not
      necessarily our friends. Just last year the Iranian government was
      repressing women, national minorities and workers who rose up under the
      slogan “women, life, freedom”. How can the Palestine solidarity movement
      uphold our stance as principled defenders of democratic rights and
      liberation if we celebrate such a regime? While Hezbollah and the Houthis
      are not responsible for the same scale of oppression, they are both
      conservative movements that have played counter-revolutionary and
      anti-democratic roles in their own countries and, in Hezbollah’s case,
      abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well, the issue of identity politics has raised its head once again,
      manifesting in a new tendency to isolate the Palestinian cause from the
      broader anti-imperialist struggle. Given the highly reactionary situation
      in the Middle East, with countries like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and
      even Qatar and Turkey being deeply implicated with both America and
      Israel, this is a profoundly unhelpful position. Freedom in Palestine is
      inherently bound up with the revolutionary fight against imperialism and
      capitalism across the region and the world. The Palestinians cannot win
      such a battle on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this contradictory situation, socialists have a special role within the
      solidarity movement. We have to continue to throw ourselves into the
      struggle, trying to deepen and broaden its scope wherever possible. The
      student actions and the unprecedented

      and are just two examples of our leadership. In many cities our branches
      provide much of the infrastructure for the weekly demonstrations. But of
      course, others have taken excellent initiatives that we have supported,
      such as the regular pickets of Heat Treatment Australia and AW Bell in
      Melbourne, the union-backed pickets of Zim ships in Perth and elsewhere,
      and much more besides.

      But there is also a need to deepen the political and strategic
      understanding of people in the movement. This means grasping the nature of
      Zionism, imperialism and the struggle for Palestinian liberation. Rage at
      the ongoing genocide is an important starting point, but to confront
      Israel, the US empire and its allies – including the Australian state – we
      need the historical and theoretical grounding, strategic thinking and
      long-term organising that only the socialist movement can offer. Radical
      media sources such as <em>Red Flag</em> and this journal are vital in this
      project, allowing incoming activists to gain a more thorough understanding
      of the issues than what is possible from social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the context into which socialists must intervene is intensely
      contradictory. On one hand, millions have made new connections between
      their recent experiences with Black Lives Matter and other campaigns
      against racism, and the Palestinian cause. With the so-called war on
      terror fading into the background, this new generation is far less
      influenced by the traditional justifications for Israeli atrocities. The
      extraordinary energy of activists thrown up by this movement has been
      demonstrated. Yet inevitably, there is a fairly profound ignorance about
      the historic experiences and strategic debates in the decades-long
      movement for Palestinian liberation, in particular, the role of the left
      and workers’ movement within it. This is made worse by the fact that class
      struggle remains at a low ebb, and so appeals to working-class agency as a
      possible step in such a movement are mostly fairly abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it particularly obvious that workers and the poor of the Middle
      East and North Africa can be the basis for Palestinian liberation. The
      terrible defeat of the Arab Spring – in different ways constrained,
      coopted and destroyed by the dominant nationalist and Islamist politics of
      the region – has isolated Palestine and given Israel a relatively free
      hand. There has been very little space for mass mobilisation, which is why
      recent protests in Jordan are of enormous significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But overcoming these challenges and building a new revolutionary left is
      vital. In some ways, Israel’s war on Palestine is only a portent of
      imperial crimes to come. We only narrowly avoided a devastating regional
      conflict between Israel and Iran. Netanyahu is an increasingly beleaguered
      prime minister, with opposition growing on his left and right flanks. A
      poll by the Israeli Democracy Institute in January found that just 15
      percent of Israelis wanted Netanyahu to remain in office once the assault
      on Gaza ends. For a self-interested genocidal maniac such as Bibi, this is
      potentially a rationale for many more months of slaughter. And while it
      seems like Biden successfully convinced Netanyahu to vent his anger on
      Rafah instead of Tehran, there is still a chance of the conflict
      escalating into a wider regional war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horror of war is not confined to the Middle East. Russia’s invasion
      and occupation of Ukraine continues to grind on, leaving enormous death
      and destruction in its wake. The US and its allies, including Australia,
      are desperate to curtail China’s rise as a global power. They are
      deploying an increasingly aggressive set of economic and military politics
      to prepare for the possibility of a world war. Reflecting these imperial
      tensions, a report by the Stockholm International Peace Institute found
      that arms spending globally has increased by almost 7 percent this year,
      the fastest growth in fifteen years. So at a time when governments are
      “tightening their belts” to avoid feeding inflation, they’re investing
      trillions into bombs, tanks, submarines and fighter jets. Our challenge is
      to overthrow these murderous parasites before they get a chance to use
      them.
