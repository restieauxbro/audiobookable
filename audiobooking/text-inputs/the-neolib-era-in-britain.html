    The neoliberal era in Britain: Historical developments and current
    perspectives
  </h1>
  <p>
    The world economy has experienced four systemic crises since the emergence
    of capitalism as a global system; the years 1873, 1929, 1973 marked the
    commencement of the first three. As Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy write:
    “Each of these earthquakes introduced the establishment of a new social
    order and deeply altered international relations.” However, it is less clear
    whether, as they also claim, “the contemporary crisis marks the beginning of
    a similar process of transition”.<a

      ><sup>1</sup></a
    >
    The end of neoliberalism has been proclaimed several times before, often by
    the same people on different occasions. For example, the late Eric Hobsbawm
    regularly produced obituaries for it throughout the 1980s and 90s, lastly in
    his 2002 autobiography.<a href="#139davidson_2" name="139davidson2"
      ><sup>2</sup></a
    >
    Hobsbawm refrained from making a similar pronouncement in 2008, even though
    it would have had greater plausibility than its predecessors. For states
    throughout the developed world—including those like Britain and the US which
    had been most committed to
    neoliberalism—bought massive and in some cases dominant stakes in failing
    banks, using levels of public spending we had previously been told were no
    longer available or which could not be used without distorting the market.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thatcher’s personal demise on 8 April 2013 might then have simply confirmed
    the sense of an ending. Her funeral, although an obscene insult to her many
    victims, would have merely represented theatrical compensation for her
    admirers, who were otherwise left contemplating a world in which she was
    reduced to “a historic footnote in a culture that had abolished history”.<a
      href="#139davidson_3"
      name="139davidson3"
      ><sup>3</sup></a
    >
    Unfortunately, as obituaries and commemorative pull-outs across the
    political spectrum from the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> to
    <em>Socialist Worker</em> attested, we still live in the world which she
    helped create. A degree of scepticism is therefore in order when confronted
    with claims that that “neoliberalism has self-destructed”.<a
      href="#139davidson_4"
      name="139davidson4"
      ><sup>4</sup></a
    >
    The current crisis has not yet led to a new period of “postneoliberalism”.
    Nor is there even a crisis of neoliberalism, as Duménil and Lévy claim.<a
      href="#139davidson_5"
      name="139davidson5"
      ><sup>5</sup></a
    >
    In Alfredo Saad-Filho’s terms, we are instead experiencing a crisis in
    neoliberalism, which, in the absence of successful resistance by the
    exploited and oppressed, may lead not to its extinction, but to its further
    evolution.<a href="#139davidson_6" name="139davidson6"><sup>6</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    There is, however, one fundamental difference between neoliberalism pre- and
    post-2008. As we shall see, the key figures in the former period—including
    Thatcher herself—were always more pragmatic and opportunistic than either
    their supporters or their opponents claimed. Nevertheless, they all shared a
    small but clear set of key objectives and strategies, even though these had
    unintended consequences. Their successors in the current period no longer do
    so. Instead they display an increasingly well-founded sense of panic and
    consequent incoherence. Yet in the midst of this chaos and uncertainty the
    ruling classes of the world have found one measure of agreement: that the
    cost of the current crisis will be borne by the people over whom they rule,
    rather than by themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have therefore in many respects returned to our starting point in the
    mid-1970s. After nearly 40 years of neoliberalism the very same solutions
    are now being offered to the same problems, with the same intended victims.
    But this is not an occasion in which “the great events and characters of
    world history” are repeated “the first time as tragedy, the second as
    farce”; for if the ruling classes do achieve their goals, they will simply
    extend and deepen the original tragedy, in circumstances where the social
    welfare provision built up during the post-war era has in many countries
    already been significantly reduced.<a
      href="#139davidson_7"
      name="139davidson7"
      ><sup>7</sup></a
    >
    Resistance to the phase of neoliberalism has already begun. We are not in a
    position to say what the future of capitalism will involve: a further
    mutation of neoliberalism; the replacement of neoliberalism by a new method
    of capitalist organisation; or—however distant this may seem—the overthrow
    of the entire system. However, we can say what neoliberalism was before 2008
    and, equally importantly, what it was not.
  </p>
  <h2>Neoliberalism as a period in the history of capitalism</h2>
  <p>
    Up to this point I have treated neoliberalism and contemporary capitalism as
    if they were essentially synonymous, but this is of course precisely one of
    the major points at issue. With some exceptions—notably Alex Callinicos and
    the present author—contributors to this journal, above all the late Chris
    Harman, have been sceptical about the notion of neoliberalism as anything
    other than an ideology, or perhaps a set of policies.<a
      href="#139davidson_8"
      name="139davidson8"
      ><sup>8</sup></a
    >
    The real question, however, is whether neoliberalism is a useful way of
    characterising the entire historical period from 1973 to 2008 and possibly
    beyond. There seem to be two reasons for our suspicion of the term
    “neoliberalism” to denote a historical period, one valid, the other not.
  </p>
  <p>
    The valid reason is a response to some of the ways in which certain
    characteristics of neoliberalism, especially financialisation and debt, have
    been used to explain the present crisis. Writers unwilling to abandon core
    tenets of Marxist crisis theory, including several associated with this
    journal, have argued instead that its origins have to be found in the
    systemic long-term problem of profitability experienced by the system since
    the late 1960s.<a href="#139davidson_9" name="139davidson9"><sup>9</sup></a>
    I agree with these authors, but reasserting the inescapability of the law of
    the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPTF) is a necessary but
    insufficient approach and can produce its own problems. The school of
    Political Marxism associated with Robert Brenner, for example, tends to
    focus on the underlying exploitative and competitive relationships
    constitutive of the system, rejecting attempts at periodisation as being
    focused on mere epiphenomena.<a href="#139davidson_10" name="139davidson10"
      ><sup>10</sup></a
    >
    But capitalism has never existed in a pure form, operating according to the
    model established by Marx in <em>Capital</em>, and this is precisely why we
    attempt to identify successive stages of capitalist development. Indeed, one
    way of characterising these periods is precisely by identifying the shifting
    nature of the main countervailing tendencies to TRPTF.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the International Socialist tradition we tend to identify three main
    periods in the history of capitalism. The period of “classical
    capitalism”—that is the one most closely approximating to that described by
    Marx—entered crisis in 1873. This led to the second period, involving the
    simultaneous formation of monopolies within the heartlands of the system and
    expansion of colonialism without, ultimately leading to the fusion of both
    these processes in a new phase of capitalist development variously known as
    “finance capitalism”, “monopoly capitalism” or “imperialism”. The crisis of
    monopoly capitalism in 1929 in turn led to a third stage, consisting of the
    consolidation of state capitalism and underpinned from the start of the Cold
    War by the permanent arms economy, most completely in the Stalinist states,
    with social or liberal democratic variants in the advanced West and hybrid
    forms emergent in non-Stalinist areas of the former colonial world.<a
      href="#139davidson_11"
      name="139davidson11"
      ><sup>11</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    This brings me to the invalid reason for rejecting the concept of
    neoliberalism: our reluctance to accept, at least until very recently, that
    a new stage or period did in fact open in 1973. Faced with changes to
    capitalism it is possible to adopt one of three main positions. One is to
    claim that there has been a fundamental transformation requiring the
    abandonment of pre-existing positions. “New, new, new. Everything is new”,
    as Tony Blair exclaimed to no doubt bemused representatives of the Socialist
    International shortly after Labour’s election victory in 1997.<a
      href="#139davidson_12"
      name="139davidson12"
      ><sup>12</sup></a
    >
    But even among actual socialists there are, of course, right and left wing
    responses to allegedly novel situations. The defunct journal
    <em>Marxism Today</em>, associated with the Eurocommunist wing of the former
    Communist Party of Great Britain, adhered to a right wing version, in which
    changes to capitalism since the Second World War had supposedly so weakened
    the working class and its organisations, that only alliances with sections
    of the middle class could deliver “progressive” outcomes.<a
      href="#139davidson_13"
      name="139davidson13"
      ><sup>13</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Italian “autonomism” is a left—indeed ultra-left—response to an earlier set
    of changes, the emergence of the so-called “mass worker” during the Italian
    post-war miracle; only in this case the prospects for the working class are
    apparently excellent, not least because, in the late version associated with
    Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri at least, the working class has grown to
    engross everyone who is exploited or oppressed by capital in any way, in the
    form of a “multitude” which constitutes the new “dangerous class”.<a
      href="#139davidson_14"
      name="139davidson14"
      ><sup>14</sup></a
    >
    The latter claim shows that even individual concepts can have both
    optimistic and pessimistic versions. Guy Standing, for example, argues that
    what he calls “the precariat” is also the new dangerous class, but not, as
    in the case of Hardt and Negri, because of their potential to overthrow
    capital, but because of their potential susceptibility to far-right
    demagoguery.<a href="#139davidson_15" name="139davidson15"><sup>15</sup></a>
    In the face of this type of theoretical impressionism and the political
    indeterminacy to which it gives rise, a sense of the continuities involved
    in capitalism is an indispensable barrier to the adoption of fashionable
    stupidities.
  </p>
  <p>
    But there is a second position that, far from exaggerating changes to
    capitalism, refuses to acknowledge that it has undergone—or in some
    versions, can undergo—<em>any</em> significant changes. Continuity is all.
    More commonly, this “fundamentalist” approach is encountered in the politics
    of the most dogmatic sections of the revolutionary left where the assertion
    of eternal truths such as “capitalism is still capitalism; the working class
    is still the working class” substitute for any real analysis. The most
    famous example of this is, of course, the position adopted by the mainstream
    Trotskyist movement in 1948, where adherence, not to general claims about
    the nature of capitalism in this case, but to specific claims made by
    Trotsky in 1938 that then became the measure of orthodoxy. This example is
    particularly important in the IS tradition, which was founded on Tony
    Cliff’s rejection of these claims and his revision of their theoretical
    assumptions on the grounds that they no longer corresponded to reality. This
    was not mere iconoclasm, but a recognition that, whatever their original
    merits, history had overtaken and rendered invalid Trotsky’s views on the
    nature of Stalinist Russia, the prospects for the world economy and the
    range of revolutionary outcomes in the Third World.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cliff’s approach, particularly between 1948 and 1963, in a series of
    ground-breaking works from “The Nature of Stalinist Russia” to “Permanent
    Revolution” therefore exemplifies a third possible response to change,
    starting from the understanding that capitalism involves underlying
    continuities, without which it would cease to exist, but also that it
    undergoes periodic changes in form, which are the expressions of its
    historical development. Revolutionaries have to recognise and respond to the
    latter, rather than denying their existence just because they threaten to
    disrupt venerable organisational forms or established interventionist
    strategies. They should instead look for what new possibilities these
    changes offer, however unfamiliar or unsettling they may be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Writing in this journal in 1979 Cliff used the metaphor of “the downturn” to
    encapsulate the situation of retreat and demoralisation that the British
    working class was beginning to undergo in the late 1970s, although the term
    was rapidly extended to encompass the global decline in the class struggle
    from the post-war high point between 1968 and 1975. This was a necessary
    recognition of reality which was contested within the SWP, but as Ian
    Birchall writes in his biography of Cliff: “The real argument in this period
    was not so much with those who denied the downturn, but with those who drew
    different conclusions from the facts.” Birchall is thinking here of the
    likes of Hobsbawm and André Gorz, and, unlike them, Cliff, “was concerned
    with a shift in the balance of class forces, not with a change in the nature
    of society”.<a href="#139davidson_16" name="139davidson16"><sup>16</sup></a>
    Now, it is obvious that no one could have predicted what was to come from
    the vantage point of the late 1970s, not least because—as is always the case
    at decisive turning points—the future direction was undetermined, dependent
    as it was on the outcome of the global class struggle; but by the beginning
    of the 1990s the outline should have been clear: the mid-1970s had seen the
    beginning of a new period in the development of capitalism. We were dealing
    with a change in society, not just a change in the balance of class forces.
    But compared to our analysis of the period between 1948 and 1973, clarity
    failed to emerge from our discussion of the subsequent decades. Why?
  </p>
  <p>
    The theory of the permanent arms economy was never as complete an
    explanation for the post-war boom as tends to be assumed in our tradition,
    but in retrospect it appears that Cliff regarded it as an exceptional
    interlude in the history of capitalism, after which unresolvable crisis and
    the “stagnation of the productive forces” proclaimed by Trotsky on the eve
    of the Second World War would resume, inevitably leading to a revival of the
    class struggle, regardless of temporary setbacks: “Capitalism in the
    advanced countries is no longer expanding and so the words of the 1938
    Transitional Programme that ‘there can be no discussion of systematic social
    reforms and the raising of the masses’ living standards’ fits again”.<a
      href="#139davidson_17"
      name="139davidson17"
      ><sup>17</sup></a
    >
    There would be no more countervailing tendencies to the TRPTF, at least of
    any significance. The concluding passage to Harman’s
    <em>Explaining the Crisis</em>, first published in
    <em>International Socialism</em> in 1982—the year the neoliberal boom
    began—expresses the perspective:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This does not mean that the world economy is doomed simply to decline. An
      overall tendency towards stagnation can still be accompanied by minor
      booms, with small but temporary increases in employment… The present phase
      of crisis is likely to go on and on—until it is resolved either by
      plunging much of the world into barbarism or by a succession of workers’
      revolutions.<a href="#139davidson_18" name="139davidson18"
        ><sup>18</sup></a
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Harman later noted that the notion of “permanent crisis” was wrong: “It was
    a mistake on my part to use such a formulation—although I think excusable as
    we faced only the second real recession my generation had experienced and
    did so a mere four years after the end of the first.” But this concession
    was less significant than at first appeared: “It may not be in permanent
    crisis, but it is in a phase of repeated crises from which it cannot escape,
    and these will necessarily be political and social as well as economic”.<a
      href="#139davidson_19"
      name="139davidson19"
      ><sup>19</sup></a
    >
    I am not clear whether there is any substantive difference between
    undergoing a permanent crisis and merely experiencing an endless series of
    repeated crises: both formulations involve the same reluctance to admit that
    capitalism might be capable of recovering from the recession which opened in
    1973.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, there were immensely challenging implications for revolutionaries
    in a situation where it might not be enough to simply retrench while
    intervening as best they could until the balance of forces was once more in
    their favour. It was as if reaching an understanding of a new period, one in
    which both labour and capital were being profoundly restructured, and then
    developing a perspective and a strategy based on that understanding, was
    simply too massive, too much of a distraction from our immediate tasks to
    undertake. Without that understanding, however, our ability to accomplish
    even these immediate tasks will remain in doubt. “But history has shown us
    too to have been wrong, has revealed our point of view at that time as an
    illusion”, wrote Engels in 1895, reflecting on the German Revolution of
    1848: “It has done even more; it has not merely dispelled the erroneous
    notions we then held; it has also completely transformed the conditions
    under which the proletariat has to fight”.<a
      href="#139davidson_20"
      name="139davidson20"
      ><sup>20</sup></a
    >
    Comparable reassessments of both the “erroneous notions” which we have held
    since the 1970s and “the transformed conditions under which we have to
    fight” are now in order. Of course, preparation of such an assessment
    involves knowledge already acquired from ongoing practical intervention as
    much as from theoretical study, but even direct experience of the struggle
    has to be interpreted.
  </p>
  <p>
    What follows is therefore a first approximation, no doubt inadequate, at
    assessing the neoliberal era in Britain that has brought us to this point.<a
      href="#139davidson_21"
      name="139davidson21"
      ><sup>21</sup></a
    >
    My aim is to treat the neoliberal era as a totality. Whatever my other
    disagreements with Harman on this issue, he was certainly right to say that
    crises cannot be understood simply in economic terms. As Loïc Wacquant has
    written, “the prevalent conception of neoliberalism is economic”.<a
      href="#139davidson_22"
      name="139davidson22"
      ><sup>22</sup></a
    >
    At best, discussions of it as a historical phenomenon focus on the terrain
    where the economic and the political intersect. But to consider
    neoliberalism as a whole, we must pay at least as much attention to the
    social domain that overlaps with and mediates between the economic and the
    political.
  </p>
  <h2>The long-term effects of capitalist globalisation</h2>
  <p>
    During the period of unparalleled growth associated with the great boom of
    the 1950s and 1960s three developments took place in the world economy that
    established the framework for what followed. These rendered obsolete the
    largely national assumptions within which economic policy had been conducted
    since the Great Crash of 1929. The first was the unprecedented three-fold
    expansion of international trade, growing twice as fast as actual output
    across the period, with the biggest increase taking place in the decade
    immediately prior to the crash of 1973. But as the economies of the major
    states became more dependent on imports and exports than internal
    transactions, the relative differences between production costs across
    borders became far more significant than when the bulk of trade had been
    territorially self-contained.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second development was an increase in the extent of cross-border
    production, utilising world forces of production rather than only those of
    one territorial state—a process driven, above all, by the need to achieve
    economies of scale that were only possible within a multinational market. We
    need to be careful of exaggerating the impact of this change: the spread of
    production across several states, and the consequent partial detachment from
    the control of any one, tended to be a regional rather than a truly global
    phenomenon, and it remained more difficult for capital simply to close
    production in one area and move it to another than multinational
    corporations would have workforces and governments believe. Nevertheless it
    did strengthen the position of multinational corporations and weaken that of
    states in relation to each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third development was another example of internationalisation, but in
    this case of finance rather than production. It had two aspects. One was the
    increase in large-scale foreign direct investment (FDI). The scale of FDI in
    particular needs to be understood: it grew twice as fast as goods and
    services in the 1960s and four times as fast in the 1980s, while in the
    1990s: “FDI soared by 314 percent, utterly eclipsing the 65 percent increase
    in world trade and the 40 percent increase in world gross domestic
    product”.<a href="#139davidson_23" name="139davidson23"><sup>23</sup></a>
    The other aspect was the creation of “offshore” banking and flows of money
    capital unlimited by national boundaries: unlike factories, money can be
    moved with ease and is not dependent on protection of a territorial state or
    states. More than any other, this made government policies vulnerable to
    attack when they were seen to be acting against the interest of capital.
  </p>
  <p>
    None of these developments rendered states completely powerless in the face
    of markets—that is the myth of globalisation assiduously cultivated by
    politicians seeking to evade responsibility for their actions. Neoliberalism
    represented a choice, but it was a choice increasingly difficult to avoid so
    long as the goal was the preservation and expansion of capitalism at all
    costs. When Nixon devalued the US dollar and detached it from the Gold
    Standard in August 1971, this first of all neoliberal policy decisions was,
    as Morris Berman points out, “the <em>result</em> of globalisation”, of the
    cumulative changes brought about by the resumption of the
    internationalisation of capital after 1945.<a
      href="#139davidson_24"
      name="139davidson24"
      ><sup>24</sup></a
    >
    In so far as there is a relationship between capitalist globalisation and
    neoliberalism, it was that the former set the conditions for the latter: a
    highly internationalised economy that had now returned to crisis conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were two direct preconditions for neoliberalism. One was the
    increasing size of the capitalist enterprise. During the great boom there
    was general support for state intervention among the larger businesses and
    corporations, while small businesses retained their traditional hostility to
    it. These differences expressed the relative security of their positions
    within the market: corporations were protected from the worst exigencies of
    price competition and were able to plan for longer-term investment growth,
    often in alliance with the state; small businesses were much more vulnerable
    and, to them, the state simply represented a source of predatory taxation
    and bureaucratic regulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Increased global competition changed the relative position of the
    corporations, so that all but the largest transnational corporations were
    placed in a similar position to the small businesses of the post-war period,
    in terms of their relative size within the market: “The process of
    globalisation has sharply increased the degree of competitive pressure faced
    by large corporations and banks, as competition has become a worldwide
    relationship.” Corporations still needed a home state to act as a base, but
    they increasingly required it to behave differently. Neoliberal
    globalisation “pushes them towards support for any means to reduce their tax
    burden and lift regulatory constraints, to free them to compete more
    effectively with their global rivals”.<a
      href="#139davidson_25"
      name="139davidson25"
      ><sup>25</sup></a
    >
    Corporations therefore began to demand some of the policies long advocated
    by Frederick von Hayek and Milton Friedman, and politicians and state
    managers began to implement them, not because individual opportunities to do
    so which previously been missing finally presented themselves, but because
    changed conditions of accumulation required changed strategies. Given the
    limited number of these available (assuming them to be in the interests of
    capital), it is unsurprising that the new practices now demanded began to
    overlap with existing theories.
  </p>
  <h2>The short-term impact of capitalist crisis</h2>
  <p>
    The second, more dramatic development was the resumption of economic crisis
    in 1973/4. As Ashley Lavelle writes, globalisation is a “proximate”
    explanation for the rise of neoliberalism, the end of the post-war boom an
    “ultimate” one: “Thus, the rapprochement [of social democracy] with
    neoliberalism is best understood as a response to changed economic
    conditions, which in turn shaped the ideological and political climates to
    put pressures on governments to open up their economies to cross-border
    flows of investment and trade, in the process creating the ‘globalisation’
    many mistakenly credit with undermining traditional social democratic
    politics”.<a href="#139davidson_26" name="139davidson26"><sup>26</sup></a>
    The precise causes of the return to crisis after 1973 have been widely
    debated, but some key features are highlighted by most analysts. Increased
    price competition from West Germany and Japan within the advanced world was
    made possible by intensive investment in technology and relatively low
    wages. This forced their hitherto dominant rivals—above all the US—to lower
    their own prices in a situation where production costs remained unchanged.
    American corporations were initially prepared to accept a reduced rate of
    profit in order to maintain market share but ultimately they too undertook a
    round of new investments, thus raising the capital-labour ratio and
    increasing the organic composition of capital, leading to consequent further
    pressure on the rate of profit.<a

    As Al Campbell writes, neoliberalism was therefore a solution to “a
    structural crisis of capitalism” in which “policies, practices and
    institutions” which had hitherto served capital accumulation no longer did
    so: “More narrowly, one can say that capitalism abandoned the Keynesian
    compromise in the face of a falling rate of profit, under the belief that
    neoliberalism could improve its profit rate and accumulation performance”.<a
      href="#139davidson_28"
      name="139davidson28"
      ><sup>28</sup></a
    >
    But the inadequacy of Keynesian policies was itself the result of changes to
    the nature of the world economy which had taken place during the long boom,
    and which made these policies increasingly difficult to apply with any
    possibility of success.
  </p>
  <p>
    The emergence of neoliberalism as a conscious ruling class strategy, rather
    than an esoteric ideological doctrine, therefore took place in response to
    the end of the post-war boom, but in changed conditions created by that
    boom. The failure of Keynesianism and other forms of state capitalism
    predisposed many capitalists, state managers and politicians, not just to
    accept, but to wholeheartedly embrace, theories which they would earlier
    have rejected as eccentric, or even dangerously destabilising; but even then
    the policy shifts which followed were as often pragmatic adaptations as they
    were born of ideological conviction. In 1974 the <em>Economist</em>, at that
    time still advocating a more or less Keynesian approach, accused Sir Keith
    Joseph of being a “follower” of Friedman. Joseph responded saying that “the
    evolution of my views owes little to him”:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      On the contrary, it stems primarily…from critical re-examination of local
      orthodoxies in the light of our own bitter experience in the early 1970s…
      By early this year [1974], we had a historically high rate of inflation,
      an enfeebled economy, the worst relations with the trade union movement in
      decades, and a lost election with the greatest fall in our share of the
      vote since 1929. Surely this was sufficient incentive to rethink—we are
      practical people who judge ideas and policies by results.<a

  <p>
    In public pronouncements neoliberals initially tended to focus less on
    restoring profitability and more on reducing the amount of state expenditure
    and the size of the state itself (although usually treated as synonymous
    these are of course very different goals) and controlling inflation, since
    these could be presented as beneficial to citizens as taxpayers and
    consumers. But regardless of the way in which neoliberal goals were
    expressed, the major obstacle to the reorganisation of capital required by
    the crisis lay elsewhere. The Argentinian military junta of the 1970s had
    originally regarded their main opponent as the Peronist movement, but as one
    member later admitted, “by 1976 we already knew that the problem was the
    working class”.<a href="#139davidson_30" name="139davidson30"
      ><sup>30</sup></a
    >
    In fact, the imminence of revolution was no longer a threat by the
    mid-1970s, so in what sense was the working class “the problem”?
  </p>
  <p>
    During the Second World War the Polish economist Michael Kalecki predicted
    that although “a regime of permanent full employment” would actually
    increase profits, employers would nevertheless oppose such a development
    because it would build working class self-confidence, encourage industrial
    action for improved wages and “create political tension”. In the end,
    Kalecki wrote, “’discipline in the factories’ and ‘political stability’ are
    more appreciated than profits by business leaders”.<a
      href="#139davidson_31"
      name="139davidson31"
      ><sup>31</sup></a
    >
    The Golden Age did, of course, see many intense industrial struggles, but no
    concerted attempts to roll back the position of trade unions until the very
    end. Kalecki underestimated the extent to which employers would be prepared
    to accept pressure on wages, however unwillingly, provided the rate of
    profit was maintained at a sufficiently high level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once it fell below a certain level, as was increasingly the case from the
    late 1960s, this situation was no longer sustainable for capital, meaning,
    attacks not only on workplace terms and conditions, but also on those
    aspects of the welfare state—the “social wage”—which were beneficial to the
    working class. The main source of funding for welfare provision came from
    redistribution within the working class itself; but to the extent that it
    was also a cost to capital, a drain on investment, it was one which
    capitalists had reluctantly been prepared to pay so long as the system was
    expanding. When it began to contract, as it did after 1973, these costs to
    capital, like wages, had to be reduced, by directly attacking provisions
    directly in the hands of employers (pensions, health insurance) and shifting
    the burden of taxation even more decisively onto the working class. How was
    this to be achieved—and who was to achieve it?
  </p>
  <h2>Vanguard neoliberalism: a regime of reorientation</h2>
  <p>
    The unevenness of the global spread of neoliberalism indicates not only the
    relative strength and determination of national labour movements, but the
    presence of these qualities among the politicians who were intent on making
    neoliberalism a reality. Capitalist states are sets of permanent
    institutions run by unelected officials who act in the interests of capital
    more or less effectively; parliamentary government involves a series of
    temporary regimes consisting of elected politicians who act in the interests
    of capital, more or less willingly. But in times of crisis capital requires
    politicians who will decide on a particular strategy and fight for it with
    absolute conviction, if necessary against individual members of the
    capitalist class themselves. During the 1930s Antonio Gramsci discussed this
    type of ruling class response to crisis as “an organic and normal
    phenomenon”: “It represents the fusion of an entire social class under a
    single leadership, which alone is held to be capable of solving an
    overriding problem of its existence and of fending off a mortal danger”.<a
      href="#139davidson_32"
      name="139davidson32"
      ><sup>32</sup></a
    >
    By autumn 1976 leading figures on the right and centre of the Labour Party
    had essentially accepted the monetarist case for reducing public spending
    and indeed a number of other New Right positions besides, including those on
    immigration and education—in some cases from intellectual conversion, but in
    most from temporary expediency, at least at this stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result, however, was to both give credibility to the arguments of those
    who advocated these solutions from principle and to expose Labour’s own
    inability to deliver them in the face of opposition from a still-powerful
    trade union movement and its own left wing.<a
      href="#139davidson_33"
      name="139davidson33"
      ><sup>33</sup></a
    >
    This was typical: only in the exceptional case of New Zealand after 1984 did
    an incumbent social democratic party transform itself into the agent of
    neoliberalism before it became the dominant form of contemporary capitalist
    organisation. The establishment of neoliberal hegemony in the late 1970s
    usually required an entirely new political regime, one which did not
    reluctantly acquiesce in policies they would rather have avoided, but who
    were fully committed to their implementation and, initially, this meant the
    established parties of the right.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a British context, the role of Margaret Thatcher was therefore crucial to
    what followed. Her governments directly represented capital in so far as it
    was opposed to the working class movement (“vertically”), but could not
    represent every component of capital (“horizontally”), because there was no
    general agreement on capitalist strategy during the late 1970s, not least
    because individual capitals could and did suffer from the one eventually
    adopted from 1979 onwards.<a href="#139davidson_34" name="139davidson34"
      ><sup>34</sup></a
    >
    The transition from one form of capitalist organisation to another does not
    require the bourgeoisie to develop the new institutional forms required for
    a workers’ revolution: the state is already dedicated to the defence of
    capitalism in a general sense, but the activity of the various state
    institutions needs to be decisively turned in a specific and different
    direction. In the British case the dynamic behind the neoliberal turn came
    from a minority within the newly elected Conservative Party that acted as
    the vanguard of the British capitalist class. As late as the aftermath of
    the 1983 general election, Thatcher could still note that: “There was
    revolution still to be made, but too few revolutionaries”.<a
      href="#139davidson_35"
      name="139davidson35"
      ><sup>35</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    What was the significance of Thatcher as an individual? According to Andy
    Beckett in his history of the 1970s: “Right up until the last days of the
    1979 general election Margaret Thatcher was not the only possible answer to
    the questions the decade posed.” To support this conclusion he cites an
    assessment of her ascendancy by Alfred Sherman: “It was chance.” Callaghan
    could have called the general election for October 1978 and Labour would
    likely have won, but even if they had not and the Conservatives had taken
    office at the earlier date, the latter party would then have had to deal
    with the Winter of Discontent—a contest for which they were unprepared and
    which Thatcher herself believed would have destroyed the government before
    it had begun.<a href="#139davidson_36" name="139davidson36"
      ><sup>36</sup></a
    >
    And, as Colin Hay has argued, Callaghan’s caution in not calling an early
    election allowed Thatcher and her allies in the media to “construct” the
    “Winter of Discontent” as a crisis of governability which gathered her
    support.<a href="#139davidson_37" name="139davidson37"><sup>37</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The opposite view to that of Beckett has been taken by the Scottish writer
    James Kelman, who wrote shortly after Thatcher’s removal from office: “If
    she hadn’t been around somebody else would have been chosen. The very notion
    of ‘Thatcherism’ suggests that what is happening in this country began with
    her and will therefore end with her”.<a
      href="#139davidson_38"
      name="139davidson38"
      ><sup>38</sup></a
    >
    Beckett sees the period as involving a series of contingent events which
    could have had other outcomes. Kelman is deterministic, emphasising the
    conditions of crisis which would have ultimately brought forth the necessary
    political leadership in an attempt to resolve them in the interests of
    capital. Both arguments have some validity, but both ultimately
    underestimate the role of leadership.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thatcher was in a minority among the leadership of her party which had
    itself been elected (as it would subsequently be re-elected) by a minority
    of voters. She nevertheless had several advantages. One was the financial
    support provided by revenues from the export of North Sea oil, the price of
    which had soared as an unintended consequence of the Iranian Revolution, and
    which began to make a serious impact on the balance of payments around the
    time of the 1979 general election. If this windfall can genuinely be
    described as a happy accident in terms of her project, the same cannot be
    said for the fact that the Conservatives faced a compromised and incoherent
    Labour Party, a section of whose membership and voting base had shifted to
    the newly formed Social Democratic Party. This rather reflected the crisis
    of an entire social democratic tradition which depended on the continuing
    health of the capitalist system to provide reforms, the possibilities for
    which had now ended.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the real enemy of the Conservative government, the broader labour
    movement, was in ideological and organisational turmoil, already
    disillusioned by the previous Labour government and weakened by unemployment
    (although offered some relief by the emergence of the economy from the
    depths of the 1981-2 slump).<a href="#139davidson_39" name="139davidson39"
      ><sup>39</sup></a
    >
    Thatcher still came close to defeat on several occasions during the first
    years of the 1980s. One Thatcherite acolyte, John Hoskyns, Head of the
    Downing Street Policy Unit in 1980, later claimed that if the steel strike
    of that year had ended in “humiliation” for the government, “it is quite
    possible that Thatcher would not now be a household name, nor would union
    reform, privatisation or any other radical policies have been adopted”.<a
      href="#139davidson_40"
      name="139davidson40"
      ><sup>40</sup></a
    >
    Her position only became unassailable through two victories.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first was over the Argentinian military in 1982. The “Falklands factor”
    did not have any lasting popular impact, although it was widely believed to
    have done by writers around the then influential <em>Marxism Today</em>. The
    real impact was to consolidate Thatcher’s supremacy over the Conservative
    Party. The war was a gamble for Thatcher, not in the sense that there was
    ever much likelihood of the British forces losing; their relative weight
    compared to the Argentinians, the military balance of forces, was far too
    one-sided for that to be plausible. The real risk was that victory would
    come at the price of so many British casualties as to be publicly
    unacceptable. It did not.<a href="#139davidson_41" name="139davidson41"
      ><sup>41</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The second victory was over the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in 1985,
    which finally consolidated the neoliberal regime in Britain. In order to win
    Thatcher was quite prepared to abandon market principles and use the state,
    in Georg Lukács’s words, “as a weapon”.<a
      href="#139davidson_42"
      name="139davidson42"
      ><sup>42</sup></a
    >
    She later revealed that in 1990, when her government began to consider
    further pit closures as a prelude to privatisation, she “never had regard to
    the commercial aspects alone”. This, she claims, was partly from a sense of
    “loyalty and obligation” to the working miners who had scabbed on the 1984-5
    strike, but there was another reason: “I knew we might have to face another
    strike. Where would we be if we had closed the pits at which moderate miners
    would have gone on working, and kept more profitable but left wing pits
    open?”<a href="#139davidson_43" name="139davidson43"><sup>43</sup></a>
    Thatcher at any rate understood that the general interests of her class
    sometimes required the adoption of strategies that were contrary to
    particular economic doctrines.
  </p>
  <p>
    These victories demonstrated that Thatcher was the genuine embodiment of the
    bourgeois vanguard, an anti-Lenin prepared to take risks before which more
    cautious but less decisive members of her class would have retreated or
    sought compromise. She was necessary to capitalism in Britain in a way that,
    say, Ronald Reagan was not to capitalism in the US, his role being that of a
    charismatic but replaceable front-man for the collective leadership of
    neoconservative ideologues and corporate representatives which actually
    directed White House policy during his presidency.<a
      href="#139davidson_44"
      name="139davidson44"
      ><sup>44</sup></a
    >
    In that sense Kelman was wrong. Neoliberalism could not have been introduced
    at the speed and intensity it was without Thatcher or a similar personality.
    But Beckett is also wrong. The crisis in which British capitalism was
    engulfed would have forced whichever party was in office to move in
    neoliberal directions, albeit more slowly and with greater caution; there
    could be no return to the final years of the Golden Age, which Beckett is
    concerned to defend.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attack on trade union power involved three chronologically overlapping
    strategies. The first was to deliberately allow mass unemployment to grow by
    maintaining high interest rates and refusing to provide state aid to
    industries in the form of subsidies, contracts or import controls.
    Interviewed by Adam Curtis in 1992 for his BBC documentary
    <em>Pandora’s Box</em>, Sir Alan Budd said that he was concerned that some
    of politicians “never believed for a moment that this was the correct way to
    bring down inflation”:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      They did, however, see that it would be a very, very good way to raise
      unemployment, and raising unemployment was an extremely desirable way of
      reducing the strength of the working classes—if you like, that what was
      engineered there in Marxist terms was a crisis of capitalism which
      re-created a reserve army of labour and has allowed the capitalists to
      make high profits ever since.<a
        href="#139davidson_45"
        name="139davidson45"
        ><sup>45</sup></a
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    By January 1982 unemployment in Britain exceeded 3 million for the first
    time since the 1930s and remained at roughly this level until 1986: “Benefit
    payments were sufficiently low to cut many people off from the company of
    those who remained in work, which itself reduced the possibility of working
    class solidarity, but they were not so low that they induced the desperation
    that might have come from the prospect of starvation”.<a
      href="#139davidson_46"
      name="139davidson46"
      ><sup>46</sup></a
    >
    The effect of growing unemployment on the workplace was to discipline trade
    unionists into accepting what would previously have been unacceptable,
    including foregoing wage increases or even agreeing to reductions in
    existing wage levels (“givebacks”) in order to prevent closures which were
    in many cases only postponed. In some respects this internal discipline
    still persists. When workers express their concern over the possibility of
    redundancy, it is often treated as a proof of precarity when, as Kevin
    Doogan has pointed out, it is not the “likelihood” of job loss that is
    uppermost in their minds, but the “consequences”—the possibility of a
    catastrophic fall in income, inability to pay debts, bankruptcy and
    homelessness, all accompanied by enforced interaction with state
    institutions whose default attitude towards the unemployed is suspicion or
    outright hostility.<a href="#139davidson_47" name="139davidson47"
      ><sup>47</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The second strategy, the success of which ensured that little effective
    resistance to closures took place, was to provoke decisive confrontations
    between state-backed employers and one or two important groups of unionised
    workers: the showdowns with postal workers in Canada (1978), car workers in
    Italy (1980), air traffic controllers in the US (1981), textile workers in
    India (1982) all preceded that with the miners in the UK (1984-5). In 1981
    the then general secretary of the Scottish Trade Union Congress, Jimmy
    Milne, denied that the current recession was comparable to that of the
    1930s: “The 30s happened after the severe defeat of the 1926 General Strike.
    Today the movement is largely undefeated and it is still unbroken”.<a
      href="#139davidson_48"
      name="139davidson48"
      ><sup>48</sup></a
    >
    This was true in the sense that there had been no single defeat comparable
    to that of the British General Strike; indeed, the so-called “Winter of
    Discontent” of 1978-9 in Britain had seen the highest level of strike days
    since 1926 in actions which were largely successful: 29,474,000 strike days
    were “lost” in 1979 compared to 14,750,000 in 1974. But unlike the latter
    year, or the period from 1968 to 1975 more generally, these strikes were not
    imbued with feelings of optimism and hope, but of pessimism and despair.
  </p>
  <p>
    The labour movement had been organisationally and ideologically weakened
    both by compromises with social democracy in office (the “Social Contract”)
    and an inability to conceive of any alternative to it in opposition. The
    imposition of neoliberal regimes required imposing the type of defeat which
    had not yet occurred, but which the weakening of the trade unions made
    possible. These defeats then acted as examples to other unions, against a
    background of multiplying legal restraints and increasing employer
    intransigence. Victory was not guaranteed in advance; it was achieved not
    only by the unleashed power of the state—formidable though that was—but also
    by the failure of other unions and the TUC to give effective support to
    unions under attack. Thatcher rightly gambled that most sections of the
    trade union bureaucracy would instead give priority to the continued
    existence of their organisations, however much reduced in power, rather than
    offering effective solidarity to those under attack.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only event which would have resulted in an alternative vision of the
    future would have been the defeat of the government by the labour movement;
    in concrete terms, the victory of the NUM in the Great Miners’ Strike. This
    was by no means the impossibility that tends to be argued by those
    who—openly or not—welcomed the actual outcome; there were crucial turning
    points at which the NUM could have achieved victory as late as six months
    into the strike.<a href="#139davidson_49" name="139davidson49"
      ><sup>49</sup></a
    >
    Neoliberalism could have suffered a reverse in Britain, as it was later to
    do in France in 1995, and this would have spared many people from the
    ravages that in fact occurred. Trade union membership reached an all-time
    high in 1980 of 13,289,000; by 1990 this had fallen to 9,947,000 and by 1997
    to 7,841,000. What is less clear is whether resistance within Britain would
    have qualitatively shifted the balance in international terms to the extent
    of preventing neoliberalism becoming established as the dominant regime of
    capitalist organisation at the international level. Once the neoliberal
    order had been established in the US and imposed on the transnational
    economic institutions which it controls, the model acquired a cumulative
    force: in the developed world the need to compete with the US compelled
    other states to try to adopt the organisational forms which seemed to have
    given that economy its advantage; in the Global South states accepted
    conditions which restructured their economies in neoliberal ways in order to
    obtain access to loans and aid.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third strategy was to establish new productive capacity, and sometimes
    virtually new industries, in geographical areas with low or non-existent
    levels of unionisation and to prevent as far as possible the culture of
    membership from becoming established; latterly the process was repeated in
    the very areas, like Glasgow, where unionisation had previously been
    strongest. One of the reasons why unemployment remained high even though new
    jobs were being created was that these involved new entrants to the labour
    market such as married women and the young, rather than those who had lost
    their jobs. This was a more prolonged, molecular process than the first two
    strategies, and one in which the employers rather than the state took the
    lead, although the latter gave support through grants, subsidies and tax
    breaks. If the classic example of this strategy was the movement of
    productive capital from the old “rustbelt” industrial regions of the north
    east USA to the southern sunbelt, similar, less extreme versions of the same
    process took place in England (from the north east and north west to the “M4
    Corridor”) and Scotland (from Glasgow to “Silicon Glen” and the New Towns
    like Livingston). By 1987 fewer than one male worker in ten in Glasgow was
    employed in manufacturing while nearly a quarter of all workers were women
    employed in public services.<a href="#139davidson_50" name="139davidson50"
      ><sup>50</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    These geographical shifts <em>within</em> nation-states were more common and
    more damaging to trade union organisation than the threatened geographical
    shifts to locations in the Global South, threats which were often made by
    employers, but far less frequently carried out, not least because of the
    uncertainties over the ability of developing states to provide technological
    infrastructure and the cost in abandoning fixed capital which such
    relocations involved.<a href="#139davidson_51" name="139davidson51"
      ><sup>51</sup></a
    >
    However, as Graham Turner notes, “it is the threat of relocation that proves
    just as powerful as the reality of a transfer somewhere cheaper”.<a
      href="#139davidson_52"
      name="139davidson52"
      ><sup>52</sup></a
    >
    These threats proved successful at least in part because of the way in which
    sections of the trade union bureaucracy and the left have exaggerated the
    extent of outsourcing and external relocation, the principal effect of which
    has been to further reduce the confidence of union members to resist.<a
      href="#139davidson_53"
      name="139davidson53"
      ><sup>53</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The relative success of these strategies allowed corporate restructuring,
    the closing of “unproductive” units and the imposition of “the right of
    managers to manage” within the workplace, which in turn ensured that wage
    costs fell and stayed down, so that the share of profits going to capital
    was increased. The neoliberal onslaught also opened up the possibility of
    two longer-term developments, to which I will return below. The first was to
    increase the probability that, when economic growth was resumed, working
    class organisation would not be in a position to take advantage of increased
    profit rates by pushing for higher wages and better conditions: in other
    words, that any future boom would primarily benefit capital, not labour. In
    Britain trade union density in 1979 was 55.4 percent; by 1983, 47.6 percent;
    by 1987, 43.4 percent; by 1992, 36.3 percent; and by 1997, 29.9 percent.<a
      href="#139davidson_54"
      name="139davidson54"
      ><sup>54</sup></a
    >
    The second was to assist the social and liberal democratic parties to adapt
    to neoliberalism by weakening the main source of countervailing pressure
    from the broader labour movement, thus ensuring that fiscal and other
    changes favourable to capital were less likely to be reversed.

    The successful onslaught on the labour movement allowed all the other
    components of the neoliberal repertoire that Harman called “anti-reforms” to
    be implemented.<a href="#139davidson_55" name="139davidson55"
      ><sup>55</sup></a
    >
    Any catalogue of those which proved more enduring would have to include the
    following, although the list is by no means exhaustive: privatisation of
    state-owned industries and utilities, flexible labour markets, outsourcing
    of non-core functions, deregulation of financial markets and the removal of
    exchange controls, abolition of protective tariffs and subsidies on
    essential goods, commodification of services once provided free at the point
    of use, the shift from direct and progressive to indirect and regressive
    taxation, and a monetary policy dedicated to the maintenance of low levels
    of inflation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Neoliberalism as a system incorporating these elements only emerged in a
    piecemeal fashion, after many false starts, accidental discoveries,
    opportunistic manoeuvres and unintended consequences. Privatisation is
    usually treated as an example of how theory was turned into practice by the
    Conservative regime after 1979, not least by Thatcher herself, in whose
    autobiography it is retrospectively presented as a consistently held
    component of her programme for transforming Britain.<a
      href="#139davidson_56"
      name="139davidson56"
      ><sup>56</sup></a
    >
    There is no doubt that this led to major changes in social and economic life
    by the opening years of the 21st century.<a

    In particular it offered longer-term advantages to individual <br />
    capitalists (and to the state managers and politicians with whom they
    increasingly exchanged roles), if not to their states or the system as a
    whole: it allowed companies to expand markets into sectors from which they
    were previously excluded and established conditions for international
    mergers and acquisitions which state-ownership tended to deter.<a
      href="#139davidson_58"
      name="139davidson58"
      ><sup>58</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    But the privatisation strategy was largely improvised in response to the
    adverse circumstances Thatcher encountered during her first term in office,
    and in particular to the combined impact of two pressures on the government,
    which were themselves aspects of the economic crisis that helped propel the
    Conservatives into office in the first place. One was the continued upward
    pressure on state spending caused by both the need for technological
    investment in the public sector and high levels of unemployment; the sale of
    key industries and services would both remove the need for the former and
    provide the Treasury with revenue to meet the latter. The other was the
    continuing fact of minority support for the Conservatives, despite two
    general election victories made possible by the British electoral system;
    the creation of mass share ownership from the flotation of state-owned
    public assets seemed to offer the possibility of a “people’s capitalism”
    whose adherents would henceforth look to the Conservatives as their natural
    political home.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond the short-term cash injection attendant on each sale, neither of
    these goals was achieved. The current costs of subsidising the fragmented
    rail network, post-privatisation, may actually be greater than those
    formerly incurred by subsidising British Rail, while there is no evidence to
    suggest that either former tenants who bought their council houses, or
    workers who bought shares in privatised companies were any more likely to
    vote Conservative than before.<a href="#139davidson_59" name="139davidson59"
      ><sup>59</sup></a
    >
    Anthony Heath and his colleagues found in their study of the British General
    Election of 1983 that the council house buyers who voted Conservative were
    already predisposed to do so and that those who had previously voted Labour
    continued to do so in the same proportion as those who remained council
    house tenants.<a href="#139davidson_60" name="139davidson60"
      ><sup>60</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    But neoliberal hegemony need not manifest itself in voting for the
    Conservatives. In fact, the ideological impact of privatisation on the
    working class was in most cases more subtle than is usually supposed. The
    shift which most people in Britain were forced to make from rented council
    housing to private home ownership, for example, did not in itself signal a
    dilution of working class consciousness; it did, however, mean that workers
    were in a weaker strategic position. As the Scottish novelist Alan Bissett
    notes of his friends’ current situation: “They can’t go on strike for longer
    than a day, because, well, <em>who’s going to pay the mortgage</em>?”<a
      href="#139davidson_61"
      name="139davidson61"
      ><sup>61</sup></a
    >
    Any prolonged industrial action by workers threatened their ability to meet
    debt repayments and consequently raised the prospect of repossession,
    bankruptcy and homelessness, and this is, of course, a function of debt more
    generally.
  </p>
  <p>
    The situation led to caution in the face of neoliberal attacks, not
    conversion to the truth of neoliberal beliefs. Indeed, the way in which high
    interest rates tended to turn home ownership into a massive financial burden
    or even, in the era of negative equity, an outright liability was inclined
    to produce dissatisfaction with the system rather than acceptance of it. The
    real ideological consequences of privatisation occurred in two other ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first is that when public services like health and education are
    privatised (or simply run as if they were private companies) those aspects
    of service provision which are not purely functional for capital, such as
    social justice in the case of the former and personal development in that of
    the latter, tend to be reduced.<a
      href="#139davidson_62"
      name="139davidson62"
      ><sup>62</sup></a
    >
    In education there is an additional ideological component. As Sheldon Wolin
    notes, privatisation “represents more than a switch in suppliers”, it also
    involves a “culture of competitiveness, hierarchy, self-interest”. Even
    under capitalism education involves not only the acquisition of literacy and
    other skills, but empowerment, in so far as students develop the ability to
    think independently: “Privatisation of education signifies not an abstract
    transfer of public to private but a takeover of the means to reshape the
    minds of coming generations, perhaps to blend popular education and media
    culture so as better to manage democracy”.<a
      href="#139davidson_63"
      name="139davidson63"
      ><sup>63</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The second consequence of privatisation is that when the state retreats from
    ownership and control it is much easier to present the effects of recession
    as outwith the reach of human intervention, except through participation in
    the market. “Separating industry off from the state and subjecting it to the
    market can depoliticise the attacks on workers that accompany the crisis,”
    explains Harman, “shifting the blame to the seemingly automatic, natural
    forces of the market”.<a href="#139davidson_64" name="139davidson64"
      ><sup>64</sup></a
    >
    At the same time, once the market is naturalised in this way, it can also
    have a consoling effect on those who suffer from its operations: “Frederick
    Hayek knew that it was much easier to accept inequalities if one can claim
    that they result from an impersonal blind force”, writes Slavoj Zizek, and
    “the good thing about the ‘irrationality’ of the market and success and
    failure in capitalism is that it allows me precisely to perceive my failure
    or success as ‘undeserved’, contingent”.<a
      href="#139davidson_65"
      name="139davidson65"
      ><sup>65</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Within a ten-year period, between the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and
    the Battle of Seattle in 1999, all of the vanguard regimes of reorientation
    had been replaced by parties, or at any rate, individual politicians
    ostensibly committed to an alternative path: Chile (1989), New Zealand
    (1990), the USA (1992), Britain (1997), and the USSR (1999). Yet as
    Callinicos notes, “the hegemony of neoliberalism is demonstrated precisely
    by the fact that its policies survived the electoral defeat of the parties
    that inaugurated it”.<a href="#139davidson_66" name="139davidson66"
      ><sup>66</sup></a
    >
    This suggests two questions. First, why did nothing fundamental change?
    Second, since it did not, why could the neoliberal order not simply have
    been maintained by the original vanguard regimes?
  </p>
  <h2>Social neoliberalism: a regime of consolidation</h2>
  <p>
    Neoliberals claim that the establishment of free market policies will
    automatically produce comparably beneficial effects in other areas of social
    life. Not only are these claims false, neoliberalism also exacerbates all
    the inherent evils which capitalism involves in all its incarnations.
    Consequently, so long as citizens are able to vote, and as long as they have
    political parties prepared to represent their interests, however
    inadequately, for which to vote, there is always the possibility that the
    neoliberal order might be undermined. Neoliberal ideologues offer two
    solutions to this ruling class dilemma.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first was to ensure that only sympathetic politicians are in control of
    the state, if necessary by non-democratic means. Hayek argued against making
    a “fetish of democracy” from <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> (1944) onwards,
    but his position is perhaps most clearly expressed in a justly infamous
    letter to the <em>Times</em> in 1978, where he wrote: “I have not been able
    to find a single person even in much-maligned Chile who did not agree that
    personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under
    Allende”.<a href="#139davidson_67" name="139davidson67"><sup>67</sup></a>
    The Chilean option is not, however, the preferred one, mainly because of the
    many inconveniences which military and still more fascist dictatorships tend
    to involve for bourgeoisies themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second solution was suggested precisely by the recognition that while
    formal democracy was desirable, substantive democracy was problematic. And
    in this respect at least, neoliberalism has attempted to implement the
    programme of its theoretical antecedents. Ellen Meiksins Wood rightly
    identifies the current attitude of the US ruling class to democracy as
    consisting of two strategies: “One is to find electoral processes and
    institutions that will thwart the majority in one way or another. The
    other—and this is ultimately the most important—is to empty democracy of as
    much social content as possible”.<a
      href="#139davidson_68"
      name="139davidson68"
      ><sup>68</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    In concrete terms, it was increasingly apparent to more thoughtful members
    of the bourgeoisie that initial successes against the working class based on
    a strategy of all-out frontal attack had reached the limit of what was
    possible, particularly in Britain where the regime overreached itself by
    imposing a poll tax which provoked the first example of successful
    generalised resistance to the neoliberal programme. The earlier onslaught
    had achieved the basic aim of weakening the labour movement, instilling
    among the trade union bureaucracy a generalised structural reluctance to
    engage in official all-out action. The achievement of this condition is
    perhaps the greatest service neoliberalism has achieved for capital. Yet
    these same successes meant that it was possible to consider supporting, or
    at least tolerating, different parties from those of the right that had
    formed the original vanguard.<a href="#139davidson_69" name="139davidson69"
      ><sup>69</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Perry Anderson has pointed out that an electoral base, even a much reduced
    one, is unlikely to be attracted by “the pure doctrine of the free market
    that is the animating spirit of neoliberalism”. But the “ideological
    supplements” offered by Thatcher and Reagan—respectively imperialist
    nationalism and religious fundamentalism—were as likely to alienate support
    as to cultivate it. What were required were “regimes of consolidation”,
    formally characterised by social or liberal democratic rhetoric, which were
    able to incorporate the rhetoric of social solidarity while maintaining and
    even extending the essential components of neoliberalism.<a
      href="#139davidson_70"
      name="139davidson70"
      ><sup>70</sup></a
    >
    The social and liberal democratic parties could therefore bring an
    additional, more ameliorative element into the otherwise forbiddingly bleak
    repertoire of neoliberalism. This apparent supplementing of the naked laws
    of the market was originally marketed as a “third way” between traditional
    social democracy and neoliberalism.<a
      href="#139davidson_71"
      name="139davidson71"
      ><sup>71</sup></a
    >
    It is more accurately described by Alex Law and Gerry Mooney as “social
    neoliberalism”, since it involves not a synthesis of the two, but an
    adaptation of the former to the latter.<a
      href="#139davidson_72"
      name="139davidson72"
      ><sup>72</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The transition from regime of reorientation to regime of consolidation
    involved a transition from what, in Gramsci’s terms, was a war of manoeuvre
    to a war of position: the first involved a frontal onslaught on the labour
    movement and the dismantling of formerly embedded social democratic
    institutions (“roll-back”); the second involved a more molecular process
    with the gradual commodification of huge new areas of social life and the
    creation of new institutions specifically constructed on neoliberal
    principles (“roll-out”).<a href="#139davidson_73" name="139davidson73"
      ><sup>73</sup></a
    >
    Central to this shift were the social democratic parties that had
    traditionally seen their role as reforming or even transcending capitalism.
    How did they come to play the role of open, unapologetic, supporters of the
    capitalist system in its most uninhibited form?
  </p>
  <p>
    Gregory Elliott argues that social democracy evolved over three distinct
    periods: 1889-1945, 1945-1975, and 1975 to date.<a
      href="#139davidson_74"
      name="139davidson74"
      ><sup>74</sup></a
    >
    As a movement, it has always been fundamentally supportive of capitalism in
    practice, but during the first period it was at least programmatically
    committed to abolishing it. The second period coincided with the post-war
    boom and allowed the possibility of positive reforms for the working class
    without threatening the system, although these were also delivered by forces
    to the right of social democracy, by Christian democracy in particular. Once
    the possibility of reform was removed, all that remained, for the
    leaderships at any rate, was the commitment to capitalism and some residual
    rhetoric. Central to this process was the crisis of Keynesianism. In
    ideological terms, the collapse of the Stalinist regimes did not so much
    “prove” as confirm the already widely held belief that any alternative form
    of economy to neoliberal capitalism was impossible.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Blair took office he did not need to reconstruct the state on
    neoliberal lines, as that had already been accomplished by Thatcher: he
    inherited the new structure ready made. Relationships between the leadership
    and the party membership were also different. Like Thatcher, Blair was in a
    minority in the leadership of his own party, but could draw on the support
    of a membership which was prepared to support more radical changes in
    policy. But here the comparisons break down. Thatcher was supported by
    Conservative Party members who saw her as returning to <br />
    traditional policies eroded by years of compromise with the trade unions and
    social democracy. Blair was supported by Labour Party members who were
    prepared to abandon traditional policies out of desperation at their
    apparent inability to win elections and the consequent need to compromise
    with the policies of the Conservatives, which were assumed to have a popular
    resonance. In many cases the bitterness of this compromise was only made
    palatable by the self-delusion that the leadership was only pretending to
    embrace neoliberalism in order to gain power, after which the reforms they
    wished to see would be implemented.
  </p>
  <p>
    No such reversal took place, of course—if anything, the New Labour
    leadership embraced capitalism and capitalists more enthusiastically than
    representatives of the traditional right have ever found necessary. As the
    house journal of neoliberalism, the <em>Economist</em>, noted, Blair’s
    “lasting legacy” was the way in which no mainstream politician now pursues
    policies that are radically different from his: “New Labour’s particular
    blend of free-marketry and social justice is now widely seen as the natural
    path of British politics, and few politicians of any stripe would dare veer
    far from it”.<a href="#139davidson_75" name="139davidson75"
      ><sup>75</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the key successes that neoliberalism has achieved for capital has
    therefore been to render inconceivable alternatives to the economic policies
    established by the initial regimes of reorientation—or at any rate,
    alternatives to their left. In Britain, for example, each successive phase
    of the neoliberal experiment saw the incremental abandonment of the
    repertoire of measures through which governments had traditionally
    influenced economic activity, beginning with Geoffrey Howe’s abandonment of
    exchange controls in 1979 and concluding (to date) with Gordon Brown’s
    transfer of the power to set interest rates from the Treasury to an
    unelected committee of the Bank of England. Anderson described the former as
    the Thatcher regime’s “first and most fundamental act on coming to power”,
    but the same may be said of the second in relation to Thatcher’s
    successor.<a href="#139davidson_76" name="139davidson76"><sup>76</sup></a>
    The acceptance of neoliberal economic nostrums among mainstream parties has
    led a form of “depoliticisation”, which, as Peter Burnham says, “is a
    governing strategy and in that sense remains highly political”; it is a
    strategy which operates by “placing at one remove the political character of
    decision making”. It can take three forms:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      First, there has been a reassignment of tasks away from the party in
      office to a number of ostensibly “non-political” bodies as a way of
      underwriting the government’s commitment to achieving objectives… The
      second form…is in the adoption of measures ostensibly to increase the
      accountability, transparency and external validation of policy… Finally,
      depoliticisation strategies have been pursued in an overall context
      favouring the adoption of binding “rules” which limit government room for
      manoeuvre.<a href="#139davidson_77" name="139davidson77"><sup>77</sup></a>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The potential for these developments has always been present in capitalist
    democracy. During the 1930s Gramsci distinguished between what he called
    “conjunctural” and “organic” phenomena. The former “do not have any very
    far-reaching historical significance; they give rise to political criticism
    of a minor, day to day character, which has as its subject top political
    leaders and personalities with direct governmental responsibilities”. The
    latter, on the other hand “give rise to socio-historical criticism, whose
    subject is wider social groupings—beyond the top figures and beyond top
    leaders”.<a href="#139davidson_78" name="139davidson78"><sup>78</sup></a>
    What has changed is that the conjunctural is no longer an aspect of
    politics; it has become its essence. Consequently, most discussion of
    politics—in the developed world at least—is devoted to expending more or
    less informed commentary and speculation on essentially meaningless
    exchanges within parliaments and other supposedly representative
    institutions. Peter Oborne’s discussion of party convergence in Britain
    incorrectly assumes the process is complete, rather than simply well
    advanced, but his essential point is valid: “In practice the differences
    between the main parties are minor and for the most part technical. The
    contradiction between apparently bitter party competition on the political
    stage, and collaboration behind the scenes, defines the contemporary
    political predicament”.<a href="#139davidson_79" name="139davidson79"
      ><sup>79</sup></a
    >
    Debates therefore have the quality of a shadow play, an empty ritual in
    which trivial or superficial differences are emphasised in order to give an
    impression of real alternatives and justify the continuation of party
    competition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The increasing irrelevance of politics has given rise to several clear
    trends across the West, not only in Britain, including increasing voter
    volatility and decreasing partisanship, indicating that many of those
    electors still involved in casting their vote do so—appropriately enough—on
    a consumer model of political choice, where participation is informed by
    media-driven perceptions of which result will be to their immediate personal
    benefit. Unsurprisingly, the numbers prepared to carry out even this minimal
    level of activity are declining.<a
      href="#139davidson_80"
      name="139davidson80"
      ><sup>80</sup></a
    >
    A British survey from 2004 showed that New Labour’s triumphant re-election
    of 2001 was achieved on the basis of the lowest poll (59 percent) in any
    post-war election, although it has since sunk further. The lowest point
    prior to 2004 was the general election of 1997, when the Labour Party,
    supposedly reunited with its electoral base, actually won with a lower share
    of the vote than it received in 1987, when it lost to the Conservatives for
    the third time in a row.<a href="#139davidson_81" name="139davidson81"
      ><sup>81</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The combination of increasing political convergence on the one hand and
    voter abstention on the other has led to a reconfiguration of the
    relationship between politicians and the state outlined at the beginning of
    this section. As Peter Mair notes, where once they were as concerned with
    “representation” as with “procedure”, the emphasis has now shifted
    decisively to the latter, away from civil society towards the state:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Parties have become agencies that govern—in the widest sense of the
      word—rather than represent; they bring order rather than give voice. It is
      in this sense that we can also speak of the disengagement or withdrawal of
      the elites, although while exiting citizens are often headed towards more
      privatised worlds, the exiting political leadership is retreating into an
      institutional one—a world of public offices.<a
        href="#139davidson_82"

        ><sup>82</sup></a

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>The balance sheet of neoliberalism</h2>
  <p>
    So much for the process by which our current situation was brought about:
    what type of Britain did the neoliberals create between the economic crises
    of 1973 and 2008? And how far does that world resemble the one they actually
    wanted to create?
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>A boom economy</em>? David Harvey has argued that neoliberalism can be
    interpreted “either as a utopian project to realise a theoretical design for
    the reorganisation of international capitalism or as a political project to
    re-establish the conditions for capital accumulation and restore the power
    of economic elites”.<a href="#139davidson_83" name="139davidson83"
      ><sup>83</sup></a
    >
    There are actually three elements in this formulation, not two. One is
    neoliberal theory (“a utopian project”) which bears only a tenuous
    relationship to capitalist reality. The other two are different aspects of
    what Harvey describes as “a political project”, restoring power to economic
    elites and re-establishing the conditions for capital accumulation, although
    they do not depend on each other. I reject the first part of this definition
    on the grounds that there was no need to restore what had never been lost.
    What of the second and third?
  </p>
  <p>
    Harvey is right to observe that neoliberalism “has not been very effective”
    in this respect.<a href="#139davidson_84" name="139davidson84"
      ><sup>84</sup></a
    >
    The underlying problem is that it has failed to increase the rate of profit
    consistently. As Robert Brenner explains:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      During the long expansion of the 1990s, the average rate of profit in the
      [US] private economy remained 15-20 percent below that for the 1950s and
      1960s, and a good deal more depressed than in Germany and Japan. From
      1997, moreover, profitability plummeted in the US and across the world
      economy, even as the New Economy boom reached its zenith. Rather than
      setting the US and the world economy on a new course, the forces driving
      the New Economy actually exacerbated the fundamental problem making for
      long-term slowed growth—namely, persistent chronic over-capacity in
      manufacturing and related sectors making for reduced profit rates for the
      economy as a whole.<a href="#139davidson_85" name="139davidson85"
        ><sup>85</sup></a
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Brenner correctly points to the failure of neoliberalism in achieving profit
    rates comparable to those of the Golden Age, but this is not the decisive
    issue. As David McNally points out: “[The] great boom was the product of an
    exceptional set of socio-historical circumstances that triggered an
    unprecedented wave of expansion. But, prolonged expansion with rising levels
    of output, wages and employment in the core-economies is not the capitalist
    norm; and the absence of all these is not invariably a ‘crisis’.”<a
      href="#139davidson_86"
      name="139davidson86"
      ><sup>86</sup></a
    >
    Constant use of the great boom as a reference point is problematic for two
    reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, it has led critics to expect that any subsequent boom must involve
    similar consequences for workers in terms of rising living standards,
    expanding welfare provision and increasing class confidence. Since the
    period after 1973 had precisely the opposite characteristics, the temptation
    has been to read back from the condition of the working class to the
    condition of the capitalist system, and claim that the entire period has
    been, if not one of crisis, then at least one of stagnation. But it is
    deeply implausible to think that a system as dynamic as capitalism could
    exist in a state of permanent crisis (or even recurrent crises) for 40
    years—indeed, it would be difficult to understand why the events of the
    latter date could have had such significance had they not been preceded by a
    period of growth and expansion. There have been booms before, such as those
    of the 1890s and 1920s, during which most workers did not benefit and indeed
    continued to be subjected to generalised attacks on their wages and
    conditions. One of the objectives of the neoliberal assault, after all, was
    precisely to weaken trade unions to the point where they would be unable to
    take advantage of any improvement in economic conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, unlike Marxist economists, capitalists and managers do not tend to
    look back over a 40-year period to compare conditions then with their
    current situation. It may be deeply significant to us that capitalist
    recovery after 1982 never resumed the levels of growth typical of the
    post-war boom, but this is somewhat unlikely to enter the calculations of
    the average CEO. Moreover, as Duménil and Lévy write: “The objectives of
    managers depend on the social order in which management is performed.” These
    objectives have changed: “After World War II, management basically aimed at
    growth (within corporations and in the definition of policies) and technical
    change. In neoliberalism, the main target became the stock market and
    capital income”.<a href="#139davidson_87" name="139davidson87"
      ><sup>87</sup></a
    >
    Managers now respond to demands from shareholders to produce immediate
    returns greater than their own performance compared with last year, or with
    those of their competitors from the current year. The decisive issue is
    instead whether the rate of profit is sufficiently high for them to continue
    to invest in production and be confident of an acceptable return, and
    between 1982 and 2007 this was largely the case.<a
      href="#139davidson_88"
      name="139davidson88"
      ><sup>88</sup></a
    >
    It is true, of course, that the general trajectory of the rate of profit was
    downward throughout the period since 1973, but the key word here is
    “continue”, since the general trajectory was also downward
    <em>throughout the period of the post</em>–<em>war boom</em>.<a

      ><sup>89</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The neoliberal boom from 1982 was in part the result of the partial recovery
    from any recession caused by the destruction of some capitals and the
    rationalisation and retooling of those which survived—although as is widely
    recognised the destruction of capital was insufficient to purge the system
    of accumulated dead labour. As a result, four other factors assumed major
    importance, each of which had, however, in-built limitations.<a
      href="#139davidson_90"
      name="139davidson90"
      ><sup>90</sup></a
    >
    These factors overlapped with each other in time, but their maximum impact
    on the system occurred in the following order.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first and most fundamental was simply greater exploitation of the
    workforce, by increasing productivity on the one hand (making fewer workers
    in each enterprise work harder and longer) and decreasing the share of
    income going to labour on the other (paying workers less in real terms). The
    balance between the two differed from country to country: in Britain, for
    example, unlike the United States, it was the former which had the greatest
    impact, as average wages tended to increase—although this reflected the
    experience of workers in unionised and/or public sector workplaces, not all
    workers, as we shall see below—until 2010, when they began a decline which
    has still to be reversed.<a href="#139davidson_91" name="139davidson91"
      ><sup>91</sup></a
    >
    Both means of increasing exploitation were made possible by the relative
    success of the attack on the labour movement; both contributed to a partial
    restoration of the rate of profit. Both also had definite limits: the former
    was not physically sustainable on an indefinite basis and the latter
    restricted the realisation of value created in production by reducing
    expenditure on commodities.<a href="#139davidson_92" name="139davidson92"
      ><sup>92</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The second and closely related factor was a massive increase in consumer
    debt. As McNally notes, credit became crucially important in preventing the
    return to crisis only after the post-1982 recovery had exhausted itself. The
    East Asian crisis of 1997 and the dotcom collapse of 2000/1 signalled a
    “gargantuan credit expansion, increasingly fuelled after 2001 by record-low
    interest rates, postponed the day of reckoning”.<a
      href="#139davidson_93"
      name="139davidson93"
      ><sup>93</sup></a
    >
    The main reason for increased debt has been the need to maintain personal or
    familial income levels. The threefold strategy of allowing unemployment,
    disciplining labour and relocating production could never be permanently
    effective in cowing resistance, but the effect was prolonged by the very
    nature of the neoliberal boom. Because such growth as did take place in the
    heartlands of the system was based on investment in services rather than
    manufacturing or other productive sectors of the economy, such new jobs as
    were created tended to be characterised by more insecure employment or
    underemployment: “Britain now holds the EU record in the proportion of
    people employed in such occupations as data entry and call centre reception;
    there are as many people ‘in service’ (eg maids, nannies, gardeners and the
    like) as there were in Victorian times”.<a
      href="#139davidson_94"
      name="139davidson94"
      ><sup>94</sup></a
    >
    As the British government’s own statisticians recognise, these occupations
    are at the bottom of the pay scales; on average “personal service
    occupations earned £14,146 for the 2002/03 tax year”.<a
      href="#139davidson_95"
      name="139davidson95"
      ><sup>95</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    But the creation of low-wage jobs was not the only reason. As we have seen,
    one of the characteristic features of neoliberalism is privatisation, a
    consequence of which has been the charging for services which were once
    either paid for or subsidised out of general taxation. The levels of
    taxation to which working class people are subject have not fallen; indeed
    they have increased as the sources of tax revenue have moved from income and
    property towards consumption, but they are now additionally required to pay
    for essential services which now take the form of commodities. The need for
    higher levels of necessary expenditure by the working class therefore
    encouraged—indeed, one might say, necessitated—a massive expansion in
    borrowing. At the same time debt also provided an alternative to struggle,
    in conditions where that was difficult or impossible. While New Labour was
    in office, total debt held by individuals rose from £570.0 billion to
    £1,511.7 billion, an increase of 165.2 percent. During the same period the
    ratio of personal debt to disposable income rose from 101.6 percent to 173.1
    percent—an increase of 71.5 percent which exceeds even the increase of 49.8
    percent registered during the preceding period of Conservative government.<a
      href="#139davidson_96"
      name="139davidson96"
      ><sup>96</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The third factor is what Harvey calls “accumulation by dispossession”.<a
      href="#139davidson_97"
      name="139davidson97"
      ><sup>97</sup></a
    >
    There are several major difficulties with this notion.<a
      href="#139davidson_98"
      name="139davidson98"
      ><sup>98</sup></a
    >
    Nevertheless, in the British context, one of the processes Harvey identifies
    was important in the partial recovery of capitalism: the privatisation of
    state-owned industries and public services. Again no new value is created,
    but neither is the process simply relocating resources within the system
    from the public to the private sector. Privatisation provided resources
    which—potentially at least—could be used directly for production rather than
    in the process of realisation or as part of the social wage. But here too
    there are limits to the process. There has been resistance and, although
    there have been subsequent re-nationalisations in response to the current
    recession, the opportunities provided by transfers from public to private
    ownership were essentially once and for all operations the scale of which
    will never again be repeated. Only the NHS still remains as the great
    remaining prize for privatisation and in England at least, this is already
    happening, although in a far more fragmentary way than those of the 1980s or
    1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fourth factor, itself a result of profit rates failing to consistently
    reach what capitalists considered acceptable levels, was a fall in the
    proportion of surplus value being invested in production and the rise in the
    proportion being saved, to the point where the latter is greater than the
    former. Not for the first time in the history of the capitalist system, the
    need to find profitable uses for surplus capital, where productive
    investment was insufficiently attractive, tended to draw industrial
    capitalists towards financial speculation.<a
      href="#139davidson_99"
      name="139davidson99"
      ><sup>99</sup></a
    >
    Indeed, Duménil and Lévy have claimed that neoliberalism operates mainly or
    even solely for the benefit of the financial component of capital, which
    “managed the crisis according to its own interests, which prolonged the
    crisis” and which in turn “made it possible for finance to shift the course
    of history in its own interests”.<a
      href="#139davidson_100"
      name="139davidson100"
      ><sup>100</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it is not true that financial and industrial capital can be
    separated in this way. The Great Depression of the 1930s showed productive
    capital that accumulation could no longer depend on a largely unregulated
    system. “Financial capital, on the contrary, largely continued to adhere to
    the liberal line that unregulated markets always work best, including
    financial markets”.
    <a href="#139davidson_101" name="139davidson101"><sup>101</sup></a> The
    point at which productive capital came to share this view in the 1970s
    signalled the opening of the neoliberal era, but did not mean that it has
    become subordinated to financial capital, rather that their interests had
    converged. The new focus on finance had wider implications than the shifting
    focus of investment, which tends to be compressed into the term
    “financialisation”.<a href="#139davidson_102" name="139davidson102"
      ><sup>102</sup></a
    >
    But among all the complexities of arbitrage, derivatives, hedge funds and
    the rest, the essential point about financialisation is that speculation,
    like several of the factors discussed here, can increase the profits of
    individual capitalists at the expense of others, but cannot create new value
    for the system as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given that the system was bound to re-enter a period of crisis at some
    point, it is perhaps unfair to criticise neoliberalism for failing to
    maintain the rate of profit permanently. It did, however, provide one other
    major service to the capitalist class and the bourgeoisie more generally,
    which are outside the terms of Harvey’s definition, although it might be
    compatible with it if we recast the notion of <em>restoring</em> power to
    the ruling class in terms of the
    <em>transfer of wealth and resources</em> to the ruling class and its
    hangers-on. As Sidney Pollard pointed out as early as 1990, of all the
    advanced economies, Britain had the highest inflation, the highest interest
    rates and the highest unemployment, combined with falling output, declining
    national income and the longest hours: “The exception was the one aim which,
    curiously, the government did not stress in its statements of policy, though
    it clearly played a large part in its programme; the transfer of income from
    the poor, and especially the poorest, to the rich, and especially the
    richest”.<a href="#139davidson_103" name="139davidson103"><sup>103</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    These transfers were a general phenomenon. Duménil and Lévy note two
    movements in the fortunes of the ruling class: one involving a “relative
    deterioration” in their holdings at the beginnings of the crisis in the
    1970s, and the other “a restoration and more under the neoliberal banner”.
    The latter is what they describe as a “tour de force accomplished by the
    dominant classes through neoliberalism, both in the absolute and relative to
    the other classes of the population”, but it was one which involved
    diverting declining profits from productive investment.<a
      href="#139davidson_104"
      name="139davidson104"
      ><sup>104</sup></a
    >
    As Saad-Filho writes, in one sense, “the notorious inability of the
    neoliberal reforms to support high rates of investment or high GDP is really
    irrelevant…it <em>has</em> been able to support much higher standards of
    consumption for the top strata of the population and its promotion of
    consumer debt”. This, rather than the capacity “to promote growth, reduce
    inflation or even to increase the portfolio choices of the financial
    institutions” was the real consequence of neoliberalism.<a
      href="#139davidson_105"
      name="139davidson105"
      ><sup>105</sup></a
    >
    The neoliberal programme benefited individual members of the capitalist
    class by increasing their personal wealth, at the expense of the living
    standards of the poor and the working class. In Britain, even after ten
    years of Thatcherism, the average CEO of one of the FTSE top one hundred
    companies in 1988 earned “only” 17 times the wage of an average worker; by
    2008 it had risen to 75.5 times.<a
      href="#139davidson_106"
      name="139davidson106"
      ><sup>106</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Neoliberalism had always been an ideology—not disinterested theory, but the
    articulation of particular class interests. It is unsurprising, therefore,
    that no significant section of the international ruling class has abandoned
    its belief in the fundamentals of neoliberal capitalism: they have too much
    to lose. But neoliberalism is also an ideology in a second sense, not only
    one which presents the perspective of a particular class as universal, but
    also one which seeks to explain or justify the discrepancy between theory
    and reality, between the promise of improved standards of living for all and
    the delivery of inequalities in which benefits are reserved for the rulers
    of society. Although the clearest expression of the view that “a fully free,
    capitalist system has not yet existed anywhere” is to be found in the
    writings of Ayn Rand and her acolytes, the sentiment is much more
    widespread.<a href="#139davidson_107" name="139davidson107"
      ><sup>107</sup></a
    >
    Yet precisely because this vision is unrealisable, neoliberalism can never
    be satisfied; enemies are never completely overcome, if only because they
    must be constantly invoked to explain neoliberal failures: “Even after
    decades of neoliberal reconstruction, it is remarkable how many present-day
    policy failures are still being tagged to intransigent unions, to invasive
    regulations, to inept bureaucrats, and to scaremongering advocacy groups”.<a
      href="#139davidson_108"
      name="139davidson108"
      ><sup>108</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>A market state</em>? The other area where theory and reality have been
    at odds is in relation to the role of states.<a
      href="#139davidson_109"
      name="139davidson109"
      ><sup>109</sup></a
    >
    Privatisation notwithstanding, neoliberal capitalism could not dispense with
    their services—a truth upon which the chief executives of many an ailing
    financial institution has had occasion to reflect since September 2008.
    Unlike their neoclassical predecessors, however, neoliberals tended to
    emphasise anti-state rhetoric, whatever their record in practice. But, as we
    have seen, the opposition of interventionist state and free market is false.
    “Neoliberalism rejected the state of the social democratic compromise, not
    the state in general”.<a href="#139davidson_110" name="139davidson110"
      ><sup>110</sup></a
    >
    Indeed, in some respects states under neoliberalism have accrued even more
    power to themselves than they did during the Keynesian era.
  </p>
  <p>
    The measures of nationalisation and state control in response to the present
    crisis are therefore not a return to state interventionism, since it has
    never ceased. Indeed, even though the neoclassical and neoliberal schools
    both see an important role for states—enabling market activity on the one
    hand, disabling collective opposition on the other—their actual role in
    direct economic terms has gone much further than either theoretical
    tradition allows. Both the size of states and the level of state expenditure
    remain substantial and much of this expenditure was directed towards forms
    of state activity long established during the preceding social democratic
    era. As far as the economy is concerned, the arms industry saw no diminution
    of government <em>largesse</em> in either Britain or the US, and more
    targeted assistance was made available for companies deemed too important to
    the economy (“too big”) to fail. Harman points out that “states have
    intervened more to deal with crises since the 1970s than in the 1960s and
    1950s for the simple reason that the crises have been much more severe”.<a
      href="#139davidson_111"
      name="139davidson111"
      ><sup>111</sup></a
    >
    What then has changed under neoliberalism?
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not the amount of state expenditure and areas of state intervention
    that have changed, but where money is spent and how activities are carried
    out. The process has been one of “reorientation rather than decline”.<a
      href="#139davidson_112"
      name="139davidson112"
      ><sup>112</sup></a
    >
    As Costas Lapavistas explains: “What has vanished irretrievably is the
    notion—characteristic of post-war Keynesianism—that economic intervention
    should aim at achieving full employment and securing social welfare”.<a
      href="#139davidson_113"
      name="139davidson113"
      ><sup>113</sup></a
    >
    John Clarke and Janet Newman have argued that, in effect, this is already
    happening as the state follows a strategy of “dispersal”: “The state
    delegates—through a variety of means—its authority to subaltern
    organisations that are thus empowered to act on its <em>behalf</em>”.<a
      href="#139davidson_114"
      name="139davidson114"
      ><sup>114</sup></a
    >
    The result has involved new relationships with private capital. Welfare
    provision best illustrates the point. Until the advent of the coalition’s
    austerity programme in 2010 actual levels of spending were maintained,
    partly because of resistance to attacks, but also because there are limits
    beneath which expenditure on the social wage cannot drop without endangering
    the process of accumulation.<a href="#139davidson_115" name="139davidson115"
      ><sup>115</sup></a
    >
    But beneath headline spending figures, the services have been reconfigured.
    Care of children, the elderly and people with disabilities or long-term
    illness, for example, has increasingly been passed from the state to the
    family—which generally means the female members of the family—with these
    “informal” arrangements then subject to evaluation by state agencies: “While
    the state has withdrawn in some ways, its powers and apparatuses have been
    extended in others—transferring ‘responsibilities’ but simultaneously
    creating the capabilities of surveillance and enforcement to ensure that
    such responsibilities are being fulfilled”.<a
      href="#139davidson_116"
      name="139davidson116"
      ><sup>116</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    These changes demonstrate the fundamental difference between classical
    liberalism and neoliberalism. Mark Olssen writes that in the latter the
    state creates “the appropriate market by providing the conditions, laws and
    institutions necessary for its operation” and “an individual who is an
    enterprising and competitive entrepreneur”, the link between them signalled
    by:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      a change in subject position from “homo economicus”, who naturally behaves
      out of self-interest and is relatively detached from the state, to
      “manipulatable man”, who is created by the state and who is continually
      encouraged to be “perpetually responsive”… It is not that the conception
      of the self-interested subject is replaced or done away with by the new
      ideals of “neoliberalism”, but that in an age of universal welfare, the
      perceived possibilities of slothful indolence create necessities for new
      forms of vigilance, surveillance, “performance appraisal” and forms of
      control generally.<a href="#139davidson_117" name="139davidson117"
        ><sup>117</sup></a
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    As this suggests, it is in the areas of repression and surveillance that the
    power of the state has heightened to a degree previously unimaginable except
    under conditions of total war last experienced between 1939 and 1945.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>A broken society</em>? Since neoliberalism has been met with resistance
    as well as submission, we have seen an extension of the type of legal
    constraints earlier imposed on trade unions to social movements concerned
    with, for example, Third World debt or the environment. The limitation on
    the number of strikers allowed to picket outside a workplace, for example,
    has its analogue in the more recent proliferation of restraining orders
    issued against demonstrators outside research laboratories, company
    headquarters or in urban public space. But resistance was only one driver
    behind the growth of the state’s repressive capacities. Two other
    consequences of neoliberalism were of equal significance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first was the failure of neoliberal policies to achieve what they
    promised in material terms for the majority of people, and the resulting
    increases in poverty and inequality on the one hand, and of the illnesses,
    family breakdown and crime which they tend to bring on the other. As Richard
    Wilkinson and Kate Pickett note:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Long before the financial crisis which gathered pace in the latter part of
      2008, British politicians commenting on the decline of community or the
      rise of various forms of anti-social behaviour would sometimes refer to
      our “broken society”. The financial collapse shifted attention to the
      broken economy, and while the broken society was sometimes blamed on the
      behaviour of the poor, the broken economy was widely attributed to the
      rich.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    They argue that both breakages are in fact primarily caused by the growth of
    inequality, which is to say, by the rich:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Although it does look as if neoliberal policies widened income
      differences…there was no government intention to lower social cohesion or
      to increase violence, teenage births, obesity, drug abuse and everything
      else… Their increase is, instead, an unintended consequence of the changes
      in income distribution.<a href="#139davidson_118" name="139davidson118"
        ><sup>118</sup></a
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Unintended or not, renewed rounds of the kind of state intervention
    supposedly rejected by neoliberalism in theory were required to deal with
    the social problems neoliberalism generated in practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second consequence was not neoliberalism’s material failures, but its
    inherently contradictory aspiration to create a population that behaves as
    sovereign individual consumers in the marketplace, obedient wage labourers
    in the workplace and subordinate mass citizens before the state. As several
    very different authors have noted, a market which entrenches personal
    fulfilment through consumer choice as the ultimate value not only
    destabilises those forms of identity which have traditionally helped support
    the capitalist system, like the family and the nation, but the very personal
    constraints which allow accumulation to take place.<a
      href="#139davidson_119"
      name="139davidson119"
      ><sup>119</sup></a

    As Zygmunt Bauman argues:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      any turn of events that plays havoc with the expectations suggested by a
      person-focused ideology is perceived and “made sense of”, in the same
      ideology of privatisation, as a personal snub, a personally aimed (even if
      randomly targeted) humiliation; self-respect, as well as feelings of
      security and self-confidence, are its first casualties. The affected
      individuals feel debased, and since the ideology of privatisation assumes
      the presence of a culprit behind every case of suffering or discomfort,
      there ensues a feverish search for the persons guilty of debasing them;
      the conflict and enmity that arises is deemed personal. The guilty ones
      must be located, exposed, publicly condemned and punished. “Them” are as
      individualised as “us” in the ideology of privatisation.<a

    The political implications are ominous. Andrew Sinfield once wrote that “the
    larger danger of Thatcherism”, which can here be taken as a surrogate for
    neoliberalism as a whole, was not so much its victories over trade unions or
    social democracy, but “its eventual failure to satisfy or control the
    emotions it arouses”: “The rhetoric of Law and Order and victimisation of
    subordinate groups, with which it attempts to make plausible its social and
    economic policies, provoke forces of retribution and stimulate expectations
    that may find terrible kinds of satisfaction”.<a

    It is this that has helped feed the growth of fascism in Europe, but this
    may not be the most frightening consequence. Fascism, even under the mask of
    respectability worn by the Front National in France or by the British
    National Party, can be identified, isolated and crushed; and in Britain at
    least there has been a tradition of successfully doing so from the
    mobilisations of the Anti Nazi League and Rock against Racism in the late
    1970s, to those of Unite Against Fascism and Love Music Hate Racism today. A
    bleaker, because more insidious, scenario would be for racism and xenophobia
    to become treated as commodities which can be chosen by consumers, not as
    part of a far-right project, but routinely, like cars or foreign holidays.

    The changes in the form of property ownership brought about by
    neoliberalism, which did not in any fundamental sense alter capitalist
    relations of production, nevertheless had effects on human subjectivities.
    The neoliberal state therefore cannot simply be that of economic management,
    but also that of social control. Thus, although the late Neil Smith was
    right that “the neoconservative moment has passed” as a result of the
    debacle in Iraq, this only refers to a very narrow aspect of neoconservatism
    as a particularly “adventurist” strategic option for US imperialism.<a

    Neoconservatism as a necessary repressive accompaniment to neoliberalism in
    domestic terms is still alive and well. “The anarchy of the market, of
    competition, and of unbridled individualism…generates a situation that
    becomes increasingly ungovernable”, writes David Harvey. And in the face of
    “social anarchy and nihilism” he notes, with perhaps excessive restraint,
    that “some degree of coercion appears necessary to restore order”.<a
      href="#139davidson_123"
      name="139davidson123"
      ><sup>123</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The turn to neoconservatism in this sense will now become even more marked,
    as the unemployed, single parents, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers
    find themselves the target of a cynical scapegoating strategy to divert
    hostility away from those responsible for the crisis towards those who will
    suffer the most as a consequence of it: a classic case of blaming the
    victims of neoliberalism, in this case to shift responsibility for the
    failures of neoliberalism to resolve the problems created by capitalism.
    Unchecked, the future may well be as foreseen by George Steiner at the fall
    of the Berlin Wall, combining repression and commodification: “The knout on
    the one hand; the cheeseburger on the other”.<a

  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    If the preceding analysis of neoliberalism is correct, what strategic
    conclusions can revolutionaries draw for Britain? It was obviously essential
    for revolutionaries to throw themselves into the attempt to build a strike
    movement in defence of pensions. Similarly, an organisation like Unite the
    Resistance is required to link and inform the often very different struggles
    against austerity. But these are responses to the
    <em>immediate</em> onslaught which our class faces; what is also required is
    a strategic orientation which takes into account “the changed conditions
    under which the proletariat has to fight”, as these have developed over the
    last 40 years. Clearly this conclusion is not the place for a detailed
    discussion but some elements of such a strategy might include the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    The first is in relation to the state. One justification for the existence
    of a revolutionary party is the need for the working class to match the
    centralised power of the state with a comparably centralised organisation
    able to act decisively, coherently and uniformly across the national
    territory. This is obviously still relevant since one feature of
    neoliberalism has been a continuation of long-term tendencies, dating back
    to the late 19th century, towards the ever-greater accumulation of state
    power, especially in the areas of surveillance and repression. (that
    includes the devolved nations: the Scottish National Party government in
    Edinburgh is currently engaged in establishing an all-Scottish police
    force.) But if, as I have argued elsewhere, neoliberal strategy is
    increasingly to devolve responsibility for imposing austerity down to the
    lowest elected administrative levels, then this points towards a structure
    characterised as much by fragmentation as consolidation—with the former
    tendency being strengthened by the disintegrative effects of
    privatisation.<a href="#139davidson_125" name="139davidson125"
      ><sup>125</sup></a
    >
    In these circumstances the ability of the revolutionary party to act in a
    centralised way has to be complemented by a far greater sensitivity to local
    situations, not simply in the devolved nations, but at regional and city
    level, where a variety of different responses and initiatives will be
    required. This is not a call for the establishment of “federalist”
    structures, but for recognition of the fact that general perspectives
    conceived at a national level—which are obviously still essential—must be
    creatively adapted and applied to specific situations which arise at the
    local level.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second is in relation to the Labour Party and the question of reformism
    more generally. For revolutionaries in Britain a central question is whether
    the Labour Party has been fundamentally changed by the adoption of social
    neoliberalism. For John McIlroy there is no doubt: “What Lenin had
    characterised as a contradictory formation, a bourgeois workers’ party would
    become, in the hands of Blair and Brown, a straightforward bourgeois
    neoliberal party, its affairs complicated by the institutional role of trade
    unions”.<a href="#139davidson_126" name="139davidson126"><sup>126</sup></a>
    This obviously raises the question of how we define a social democratic
    party. Revolutionaries tend to emphasise, or oscillate between, highlighting
    different characteristics at different times, depending on the nature of the
    argument at hand. It is clear, however, that working class perceptions of
    Labour alone cannot be decisive unless they actually correspond to reality.
    Many organised workers and oppressed groups in the US regard the Democrats
    as fundamentally different from the Republicans, rather than as the second
    party of US capitalism. This does not, of course, mean that the two parties
    are identical—there would be little point in having two parties if that were
    the case. Over some social issues Democrats are notably more liberal than
    the Republicans, which has benefited workers and oppressed groups, and this
    is why the former played a vanguard and the latter a social neoliberal role.
    On fundamental issues like support for US imperialism, however, there are no
    significant differences. What is it then that workers recognise as making
    Labour different from other parliamentary parties? There seem to be three
    main qualities: (i) <em>policies</em> which are specifically designed to
    improve the condition of the working class (“reforms”) rather than “the
    people” or “the nation” in general, (ii) working-class <em>membership</em>,
    and (iii) <em>links</em> to the organised working class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, Labour has a number of important achievements to its credit.
    We tend to be over-dismissive of these, concentrating instead—for obvious
    and usually justified reasons—on the record of Labour betrayal. The trouble
    with this approach is that it makes it difficult to explain why anyone ever
    believed in the Labour Party in the first place. But these achievements are
    all in the past—in some cases the very distant past. Increasingly, voting
    Labour on the basis that it will make any practical difference is more of a
    historical memory than a contemporary reality. And this is not just about
    programmes like John Wheatley’s council house building in the 1920s,
    institutions like the NHS, or legislation like the Equal Pay Act. There used
    to be a layer of Labour activists in most working class communities—often
    quite right wing activists—who would lobby councils, organise petitions, and
    generally act as a focus for local community reformism. This layer is
    greatly diminished. These activities still get done, but it is no longer
    Labour members who initiate them as a matter of course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similar changes have taken place in relation to membership. Originally the
    Labour Party was predominantly working class, although it also had a strong
    component of the professional middle classes, typified in their different
    ways by the Webbs, Attlee and Gaitskell. It was this actual class basis that
    led Lenin to describe it as a “capitalist workers’ party”, consisting mainly
    of workers, but acting in the interests of the bourgeoisie. This class base
    has been declining since the 1960s and especially since the mid-1980s, to
    the point where the individual membership is dominated by members of the new
    middle class. In his analysis of the transformation of the European Social
    Democratic parties, Gerassimos Moschonas notes that although their
    electorates have retained working class majorities, their membership
    increasingly consists of the salaried public-sector middle class, the
    implications of which are more than numeric: “Yet given the
    <em>cultural ascendancy</em> of these strata, usually recruited from public
    service and ‘educated bourgeoisie’, as well as their considerable individual
    and collective <em>mobilising potential</em>, we are witnessing a
    <em>much greater decline in the influence of working class culture</em> than
    the strictly arithmetic relations of force disclose.” As Moschonas points
    out, while the working class presence is certainly not “residual”, its
    influence on the parties is increasingly “indirect” and exercised through
    the trade unions rather than by membership. Within the parties, working
    class participation declines and passivity grows, to be followed by silence
    and departure “which in turn reinforces middle class predominance”.<a
      href="#139davidson_127"
      name="139davidson127"
      ><sup>127</sup></a
    >
    Most of Labour’s working class membership now comes from the affiliated
    trade unions, whose role is therefore decisively important.
  </p>
  <p>
    The affiliated trade unions and, more distantly, the TUC, Scottish TUC and
    Welsh TUC acted as channels for the expression of organised working class
    views within the Labour Party. Although always heavily mediated through the
    bureaucracy, these views did influence Labour policy, a process which
    reached its peak around 1974. In theory this could still take place, but in
    practice the bureaucracy have exercised a self-denying ordinance since the
    advent of New Labour which has led to the marginalisation of working class
    influence over the party. Other than at the level of rhetoric—principally
    from Len McCluskey of Unite—there are no signs of this changing. There is no
    doubt that in purely financial terms Labour would effectively cease to exist
    without the support it receives from the unions, now that its corporate
    sponsors have deserted it. It is, however, difficult to identify many
    policies which the unions have received in return: the minimum wage
    certainly, Gordon Brown’s covert increase in public sector jobs perhaps, but
    beyond these? In fact, the main fruits of the trade union link are mainly in
    other ways: officials holding back struggle on the grounds that it will
    endanger Labour’s chances of re-election, even though, once re-elected
    Labour promises nothing but the same policies as the Tories in slow motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is therefore no accident, as we say, that the unions which are the most
    politically radical—PCS, UCU—are not affiliated to Labour and their rank and
    file tend to regard it with the most hostility. It is possible that
    affiliated unions could reassert themselves, but the point is that the main
    characteristic which distinguishes Labour from all other parties has had
    virtually no beneficial effects for the working class. Nevertheless, it will
    remain a social democratic party so long as it retains the link with the
    trade unions, which holds open the possibility that working class demands—in
    however bureaucratised a form—might once again influence what it actually
    does. But changes to the working class and its consciousness will not remain
    conveniently frozen while we await this happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since reformism remains the dominant form of consciousness within the
    working class, it may appear that nothing much has changed and that this
    reformism will continue to find expression in the Labour Party, as it has
    for the last hundred years or so. But there is no necessary connection
    between reformism in general and the specific form taken by Labourism. A
    combination of Labour’s own behaviour in office and opposition—above all its
    acceptance of neoliberalism—together with structural changes in the nature
    of the working class and the current diminution of trade union
    consciousness, means that for many working class people, Labour does
    <em>not</em> appear to be fundamentally different from the other parties,
    but is simply “the least worst” of the choices on offer. The willingness of
    working class people in Scotland to vote for a non social democratic but
    apparently reformist organisation in the form of the SNP—without which that
    party would not have been able to form a majority government after the 2011
    Holyrood elections—demonstrates <br />
    that this can have direct political effects. The central issue here is not
    whether or not revolutionaries continue to call for a Labour vote in certain
    circumstances; it is to recognise the ways in which the role of the Labour
    Party has changed. Like similar organisations in Europe and Australasia,
    Labour has moved extraordinarily far to the right; but there are more
    fundamental issues, since shifts back to the left are theoretically always
    possible. On the one hand, the Labour Party no longer acts to inculcate and
    maintain a degree of basic reformist class consciousness—a problem
    exacerbated by the fact that for over 85 percent of workers in the private
    sector, neither do the trade unions. This presents revolutionaries with a
    significant problem, since we tend to assume a set of pre-existing shared
    “social democratic” values and beliefs among the people we hope to win to
    our politics: their absence creates, at the very least, a potential barrier.
    On the other hand, where social explosions do occur—and we can assume that
    under crisis conditions they will continue to do so—the Labour Party is no
    longer in as strong a position to restrain the working class from taking
    action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the volatility of the present situation means that radical shifts
    in class consciousness are likely to occur in unpredictable ways—this is one
    of the few respects in which uneven and combined development is applicable
    in the West. It would be a mistake, however, to rely on the possibility of
    the second aspect counteracting the actuality of the first. The crisis of
    working class electoral representation requires a response other than simply
    waiting to see what kind of formation emerges and then becoming involved at
    a stage when structures and policies have already been set by other
    political forces. A better approach would be to start by identifying what
    form of electoral organisation we think is necessary (and it is by no means
    clear that <em>any</em> of the existing models is adequate) and then
    fighting to establish it—not as a way of bringing together the existing left
    (ie another round of rearranging the deck chairs on the <em>Titanic</em>)
    but of unifying those sections of the class which have broken with or simply
    been abandoned by Labour.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third and final point is in relation to the working class itself. I
    stressed earlier that the ability of state managers, politicians and
    capitalists to introduce neoliberal measures was directly or indirectly
    dependent on their success in weakening the labour movement. Any hope of
    reversing neoliberalism, let alone of moving towards socialism, will
    therefore depend on rebuilding that movement and doing so on a basis that is
    independent of political parties committed to the existing order.
    Ultimately, then, the issue is one of class power, but it is precisely this
    conclusion which even critics of neoliberalism find difficult to accept.
    Many see the working class as a residual element, at least in the West.
    “With the working class a minority,” write Polly Toynbee and David Walker,
    “those on low incomes are despised, whether they work or don’t work”.<a
      href="#139davidson_128"
      name="139davidson128"
      ><sup>128</sup></a
    >
    But even those who concede its continued existence doubt its ability to act
    as the potential gravedigger of capitalism. “Today,” writes Andrew Gamble,
    “as the capitalist wagon careers out of control down the track, spilling its
    load and its passengers, there are few gravediggers in sight”.<a
      href="#139davidson_129"
      name="139davidson129"
      ><sup>129</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The first claim, about the size of the working class, relies on the widely
    believed but nonetheless incorrect belief that the majority of workers in
    service industries belong to the middle class.<a
      href="#139davidson_130"
      name="139davidson130"
      ><sup>130</sup></a
    >
    It is the second claim, about the capacity of the working class, which
    requires more serious consideration, since the first is only possible
    because of the lack of visibility of the organised working class as a social
    agent. Neoliberalism has always been resisted in its heartlands, even after
    the 1980s defeats of the labour movement. As the example of the poll tax
    suggests, ruling class initiatives did not go unopposed. Indeed, all the
    major issues to have arisen in Britain since the late 1980s—from the poll
    tax to the Criminal Justice Bill, from hospital closures to the sell-off of
    council housing, from the British National Party to asylum seekers, from the
    imperialist wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Gaza to solidarity with the Arab
    Spring, from student opposition to increased tuition fees to the Bedroom
    Tax—have involved people responding either to attacks on their communities
    or to geopolitical injustices. The problem has been that, although trade
    unions have certainly been involved, trade union action has not been
    central. The point is not that trade unions have ceased to take action over
    workplace issues: public sector workers (and those in privatised industries
    such as the railways) in particular have continued to defend both their
    wages and conditions and the services they provide with heroic resilience
    through several decades of neoliberal attrition. But even those who rightly
    reject the claim that workers have come to accept neoliberalism cannot fail
    to notice that most workers are not unionised, above all in the private
    sector where union density currently hovers around 14 percent and those who
    are unionised often belong to declining sectors of the economy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rise of increasingly precarious (or “flexible”, in ruling class
    language) employment acts as a disincentive to organisation. The extent of
    precarity should neither be exaggerated nor underplayed. Precarity is a
    relationship to the labour market, not an indication of class position. For
    most of the history of capitalism precarity has been the normal experience
    of most of the working class. The only period in which stable employment has
    been the norm, across the developed world at least, has been since the onset
    of the great boom. Like many other aspects of this wholly exceptional period
    in the history of capitalism, this is now in decline and part of the reason
    why precarity has become an issue is because many, particularly young
    workers find themselves in a situation of precarity where they had expected
    stability. In addition, certain categories of financial, managerial and
    administrative employment which previously had the greatest security have
    now become more vulnerable, not least because of the extent of corporate
    rationalisation and downsizing that tended to follow the acquisitions and
    mergers boom of the 1990s and 2000s.<a
      href="#139davidson_131"
      name="139davidson131"
      ><sup>131</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    A more serious problem than precarity is simply the failure to unionise, let
    alone achieve recognition in the many workplaces where workers do have
    permanent contracts, either formally or in effect. Key groups like engineers
    still have the potential ability to bring individual workplaces and, in some
    cases, whole industries to a standstill; but this is more to do with their
    strategic position rather than their numerical strength. For the purposes of
    this argument the steep decline of unionisation, especially in the private
    sector, means that many working class people do not have the opportunity to
    develop “trade union consciousness”, with all that means in relation to the
    likelihood of their holding left wing political positions and accepting the
    need for collective action to improve their condition. These workers could
    be unionised, but for the moment they are not, and this has had political
    effects. Of the factors which are supposed obstacles to effective
    unionisation, there is little evidence that small workplace size (at least
    above that of the family firm), or the increasingly complex relation between
    or within firms caused by outsourcing and contracting out, or jobs
    particularly associated with women or ethnic minorities, necessarily involve
    barriers to organisation; much depends on how committed and imaginative
    trade unions are in recruiting.<a
      href="#139davidson_132"
      name="139davidson132"
      ><sup>132</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no reason why non-union workplaces should remain un-unionised and,
    although it would be foolish to pretend that there are not huge difficulties
    in the way, it would be equally foolish to believe these are insurmountable.
    Unionisation took place in Britain during the 1930s following the great
    defeat of the 1926 General Strike—think of light engineering and car
    manufacture in the East Midlands and around London, for example—and,
    although the process was hardly automatic, mass membership was established
    relatively quickly. Perhaps even more pertinently, the great unionisation
    movements in the US during the 1930s were motivated by the desire of a
    workforce to participate in the consumerist paradise of the 1920s boom from
    which they were excluded by low wages, but, even more important, by their
    resistance to the discipline of the foremen and the pressure of keeping up
    with the production line.<a href="#139davidson_133" name="139davidson133"
      ><sup>133</sup></a
    >
    These conditions are quite similar, in terms of both financial exclusion and
    the nature of the workplace regime, to those which currently prevail in the
    great telesales or financial services office-factories.
  </p>
  <p>
    What role can revolutionaries play in this process? There is always a danger
    of adapting to the environment in which we have achieved a degree of
    successful implantation, so that a particular sector is treated as
    decisively important to the working class simply because it is decisively
    important to us. The public sector trade unions play this role for the
    Socialist Workers Party. Resistance by lecturers, civil servants and council
    workers is obviously important, particularly in political and ideological
    terms, but with some exceptions—refuse workers, custom and excise
    officials—it cannot replicate the economic impact of miners, dockers and
    electricians. (It would be unwise to place too much hope on a strategy which
    assumes that the nation will be brought to a standstill by working parents
    having to stay at home during any future national action by the teachers’
    unions.<a href="#139davidson_134" name="139davidson134"><sup>134</sup></a
    >) However, nostalgia for the pits, shipyards and power stations, and its
    corollary, despair over the call centres, supermarkets and dispatch centres,
    are not only useless, but also quite unnecessary. In this context it is
    necessary to remember the maxim taught to Walter Benjamin by Bertolt Brecht:
    “Take your cue not from the good old things but the bad new ones”.<a
      href="#139davidson_135"
      name="139davidson135"
      ><sup>135</sup></a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    But unionisation has to be treated as an actual objective in which
    revolutionaries must be involved rather than merely complaining about the
    failure of trade union officialdom to do so. In other words—and this is one
    of the occasions where historical analogies might be useful—how can
    revolutionaries play a role comparable to the British and US Communist
    Parties in the 1930s in unionising aerospace and auto workers? For without
    the entry of the currently unorganised private sector workers into the trade
    union movement any revival of struggle will be unnecessarily weakened and
    limited, and their recruitment will not happen automatically. In any case it
    is not by any means clear that generalised resistance will begin in
    workplaces, although to succeed it will have to spread there. Most private
    sector workers (and many public sector workers too) do not currently feel
    strong or confident at work, and may well find it easier to mobilise in
    their communities, among friends and family, than they do at work under the
    gaze of the supervisor.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the central problems, not merely of neoliberalism, but of the
    capitalist system it seeks to defend, is that it is ultimately incapable of
    improving or even maintaining the conditions of the majority. Since, to put
    it mildly, there is unlikely to be a return to generalised boom conditions
    in the foreseeable future it is—paradoxically—in this contradiction that
    hope lies. For most people under the neoliberal order, economic life has
    become more uncertain, political life more meaningless, social life more
    fragmented and cultural life more degraded. Since, contrary to the
    neoliberal viewpoint, human beings are not just greedy little bundles of
    appetite armed with effective demand, they are rebelling and will continue
    to rebel against these assaults on their humanity. And in this context it is
    important to remember that we have not returned in all respects to our
    starting point in the late 1970s. At least some of the people who might have
    previously been persuaded to accept a supposedly temporary deterioration of
    their living conditions in order to restructure capitalism for the greater
    good are considerably less likely to be fooled again, given the way in which
    over 30 years of sacrifice has benefited only those at the top of society
    and furthermore failed to prevent a further recession. “My friends’ hatred
    of the rich is now palpable”, writes Alan Bissett:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It’s not because they themselves didn’t become rich, but because they’ve
      realised that the system was rigged all along. Having rejected socialism
      for most of their adult lives, having rejected even the very
      <em>existence</em> of a working class, they now burn with fury at a system
      which purports to be meritocratic but which in reality works against them.
      Their arrival into the “middle class” had become an illusion, sustained by
      easy credit and an economy requiring conspicuous consumption to sustain
      itself.<a href="#139davidson_136" name="139davidson136"><sup>136</sup></a>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Terrible though the experiences behind these developments have been, they
    represent potentially positive changes in consciousness, if the
    revolutionary left is capable of offering an alternative.
