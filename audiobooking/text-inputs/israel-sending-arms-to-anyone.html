    Antony Loewenstein,
    <em
      >The Palestine Laboratory. How Israel Exports the Technology of Occupation
      Around the World</em
    >, Scribe, 2023.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“War is hell but clearly it is good for business.”</p>
    <p><em>– Former chief lobbyist for pro-Israel US lobby group, AIPAC</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Antony Loewenstein’s new book <em>The Palestine Laboratory</em> is a
    forensic account of Israel’s role in creating and distributing lethal
    weaponry and surveillance technology. He details how companies use the
    occupation of Palestine as a development lab, a testing ground, and a sales
    pitch for their deadly products. Loewenstein strips away the ideological
    trimmings that are used to hide Israel’s true nature in mainstream
    discourse. He shows the reader that underneath all the talk of a “democracy
    in the Middle East” lies a brutal apartheid state which provides inspiration
    and arms to seemingly every despot under the sun. It’s a safe bet, it turns
    out, that wherever you find a dictatorial, oppressive regime, Israel is
    probably selling them weapons. And it’s not only weapons. The book describes
    the sickening developments in surveillance that Israel has sold to the
    world, with companies like NSO and Black Cube creating tools to access the
    most intimate details of people’s lives through their phones.
  </p>
  <h2>The laboratory</h2>
  <p>
    Israel’s existence is predicated on military domination over the Palestinian
    population. This has been the case since its founding in 1948. A stable and
    ever growing supply of weaponry has been key to maintaining and extending
    that dominance. From the 1930s, Zionists were building up an arsenal in
    Palestine. After 1939, Britain began military training for tens of thousands
    of Jews there. West German reparations from 1952 gave the fledgling Israeli
    state the investment to begin a weapons industry in earnest, and by the
    mid-1950s Israel’s government-owned firms were selling weapons to other
    nations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>modus operandi</em> was, in Loewenstein’s words, “selling weapons to
    anybody who wants them” (p.17). Privately owned companies developed over the
    course of the next decade. Elbit systems, one of the most prominent firms,
    was founded in 1966, the year before the Six-Day War. By 1986, Thomas
    Friedman could write in the <em>New York Times</em> that “Israel, with only
    4 million people, has become one of the top ten arms exporters in the world
    and Israeli businessmen are among the world’s leading arms merchants”
    (p.26). The industry has expanded to over three hundred multinational
    companies and six thousand startups that employ hundreds of thousands of
    people. Israeli firms lead the field in invasive surveillance tech. The most
    famous example is cyber firm NSO Group, which developed the Pegasus
    phone-hacking software. Use of Pegasus is now nearly ubiquitous among
    governments worldwide. Countless journalists have ended up dead after it was
    used to hack their phones. The governments of India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia,
    Rwanda, Hungary and Morocco have all used it against critics or opposition
    politicians. Spanish authorities used it to spy on Catalan pro-independence
    politicians. Phone-hacking software built by Cellebrite, another Israeli
    cyber firm, was sold to Vladimir Putin’s regime and has been used for years
    on dissidents.

  <p>
    Occupied Palestine is the perfect context in which to perfect murderous
    technology. Arms companies have an immediate field they can use to test
    their wares. Loewenstein documents how the recent “Great March of Return”,
    which gave hope to millions of supporters of Palestine, was used for this
    purpose. From 2018–19, thousands of Palestinians protested daily along
    Gaza’s border, demanding the end of the Israeli blockade of Gaza and the
    right to return to the homes and land stolen from them. For Israel, it
    became “a lab and a showroom” (p.77). The state tested new weaponry on the
    march, including drone technology like the “Sea of Tears”, which deployed
    tear gas and “skunk water”, a foul-smelling liquid emitted from a water
    cannon. Drones were also used to transmit messages to protesters, including
    a message in Hebrew telling Jewish supporters not to “stand with the enemy”.
  </p>
  <p>
    The occupation also serves as a sales pitch. Former South African politician
    Andrew Feinstein recounted to Loewenstein his experience of attending the
    Paris Air Show in 2009. In a luxury hotel, Israel’s biggest weapons company,
    Elbit Systems, displayed a video of a target being assassinated by drone
    strike during a military operation in the occupied territories. As the video
    played, young saleswomen enthusiastically explained the technology to the
    crowd of generals and procurement officers. Feinstein later looked into the
    strike and discovered that the events depicted in the video had killed
    innocent Palestinians, including children. A minor detail. Each of the most
    deadly events in recent Palestinian history have been used as the equivalent
    of an expo. Weaponry used in the 2014 Gaza war was profiled (ie advertised)
    in international and domestic media, including bombs, tank shells and
    drones. Vladimir Putin rearmed Russia’s surveillance system with Israeli
    drones, tried and tested in Gaza. These were used in Syrian President Bashar
    al-Assad’s counter-revolutionary war.

  <h2>Arming the world’s despots</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “I don’t care what the Gentiles do with the arms. The main thing is that
      the Jews profit.”
    </p>
    <p><em>– Israeli adviser in Guatemala from the 1980s.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Loewenstein begins with an account of the 1973 Pinochet coup in Chile. The
    event is burned into the memory of the left because of the hopes held by the
    Chilean working class in the socialist government of Salvador Allende, the
    advances in their consciousness and organisation as they fought against the
    CIA-backed coup, and the terror that the military dictatorship brought in
    its triumph. Thousands of socialists, communists and anarchists were
    tortured and killed by Pinochet’s men in Estadio Chile. Loewenstein
    describes the life of Daniel, a man whose family fled to Israel after the
    coup. He recounts Daniel’s horror upon discovering that Israel had helped
    the Pinochet dictatorship to rule, arming it with sophisticated weapons
    including missiles, tanks, and aircraft. Loewenstein quotes Eitan Kalinsky,
    sent to Chile in 1989 by the Jewish Agency for Israel. Kalinksy attended a
    protest against Pinochet and watched streams of colour-changing water which
    pushed back the marchers and broke shop windows. The spray came from water
    cannons mounted on vehicles. “Look, it says Hakibbutz Haartzi Hashomer
    Hatzair,” said a Hashomer Hatzair envoy watching with him. “We all knew it
    was made in Kibbutz Beit Alfa [in Northern Israel],” Kalinksy wrote.
  </p>
  <p>
    Israel’s backing for the Pinochet junta is part of a long-term pattern. The
    regime has developed and tested its weapons on Palestinians, and then sold
    them to despots across the world who seek to carry out similar terror on
    their own populations. Loewenstein argues that 1967 marked an important
    turning point in Israel’s international relationships. “Before the Six Day
    War,” he argues, “Israeli policy was not noble but at least gave the
    rhetorical impression of (sometimes) opposing repression” (p. 32). After the
    Six Day War, Israel’s relationships with right-wing despots strengthened,
    multiplied and became more public. Israel has long been referred to as
    America’s watchdog in the Middle East, and maintains a close relationship
    with the United States, while putting its own interests first. By partnering
    with Israel, including in more ordinary trade, regimes not only acquire
    arms, but hope to build closer ties with Washington.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indonesia is a good example. In 1967, the Suharto regime took power of the
    country following a mass slaughter of communists and anyone who could be
    smeared as such. Half a million people were murdered. Israel’s national
    intelligence agency Mossad began a close trade relationship with the new
    regime, involving beef, corn, oil and cotton production. During the 1994
    Rwandan genocide, Israel shipped weapons including Uzi submachine guns and
    hand grenades to the Hutu regime, which killed around 800,000 Tutsis in 100
    days. Israel has armed the repressive South Sudanese regime, and sold
    military equipment to the genocidal junta in Myanmar until at least 2018.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet Israel’s favourite dictators tend to be based in Latin America. Israel
    provided weapons and advice to US-backed right-wing death squads in
    Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Panama. Following a CIA-backed coup in
    Guatemala in 1954, the country had a succession of repressive right-wing
    governments. Between 1960 and 1996, roughly 200,000 people were killed in a
    civil war. Israel had a particularly close relationship with Guatemalan
    President Efrain Ríos Montt, who killed up to 75,000 people during his rule
    from 1982 to 1983. Israeli military advisors assisted him in his coup, and
    Ríos himself attributed part of his success to the fact that his soldiers
    were trained by the Israelis (p.40).
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, Israel continues to assist and inspire right-wing despots. The regime
    of Narendra Modi in India has used Israel’s occupation of Palestine as an
    example in its own occupation of Kashmir. In 2019, India’s consul general in
    New York, Sandeep Chakravorty, said: “we already have a model in the world…
    If the Israeli people can do it, we can also do it” (p.126). And it goes
    beyond just inspiration. India was Israel’s biggest weapons export market
    from 2015 to 2020, filling 43 percent of total sales. Lowenstein rightly
    argues that the two countries are linked by a mutual embrace of
    ethno-nationalism, and a material relationship built on defence exchange.
  </p>
  <h2>Israel and the migrant crisis</h2>
  <p>
    Israel has created one of the world’s biggest ongoing refugee crises by
    carrying out mass expulsions of Palestinians from their homes and by turning
    Palestine into a war zone. But it has also played an important role in the
    militarisation of the European Union’s borders. In 2020, the EU announced
    US$91 million in partnerships with Israeli weapons firms to run a drone
    presence over the Mediterranean. The drones are part of the rapidly
    expanding web of Frontex, the EU agency responsible for keeping refugees
    out. According to Loewenstein, Frontex is alerted to the presence of refugee
    boats by Israeli drones. It then often feeds the coordinates to the Libyan
    coastguard, known for being the most brutal and inhumane of all of the
    national coastguards, to intercept.
  </p>
  <p>
    Between 2014 and publication of Loewenstein’s book, 22,784 people died in
    the Mediterranean. Frontex has grown from having 45 employees in 2005 to
    over 2,000 today. It has

    and met with 108 defence companies including Israeli firms 17 times between
    2017 and 2019. Israeli surveillance firm Cellebrite provides Frontex with
    technology to spy on asylum seekers by getting into their smartphones, and
    Greece and Cyprus have conducted naval drills in the Mediterranean with
    Israel. In 2021, the <em>Guardian</em>

  </p>
  <h2>What now?</h2>
  <p>
    Given what comes before, Loewenstein’s conclusion seems somewhat
    incongruous. He places at least a vague hope in court cases, the UN and
    hypothetical Israeli liberal values in finding a solution to the crisis in
    Occupied Palestine. He writes:
  </p>
  <p>
    Israel and its supporters must make a choice between their commitment to
    Zionism and adherence to liberal values. It’s impossible to continue to
    believe in both, considering the state of apartheid across both Israel and
    Palestine. (p.214)
  </p>
  <p>
    Israel has never adhered to liberal values. The Zionism of the state has
    been based upon violent barbarism since its inception. But this final
    chapter is offset by the scathing criticism which fills the rest of the
    book, which accurately presents a picture of a despotic, sprawling arms
    industry working hand in glove with the Israeli state, the US, the European
    Union, and a plethora of dictatorships and despots.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loewenstein writes that “The need for Israelis and Palestinians to live
    together in peace has long been obvious, but mostly dismissed as unrealistic
    by opponents” (p.211). But a two-state solution, which envisages Israel and
    a Palestinian state coexisting in peace, is a fantasy.<sup

        ><span class="floating-ref-link"
          ><a

            >3</a
          ></span
        ></sup
      ></sup
    >
    It always has been. The various US-sponsored so-called peace processes
    carried out over decades have made this clear. From the Camp David Accords
    of 1978 to the Oslo Accords which concluded in 1995, all of the various
    “peace” schemes have only bolstered Israel’s power.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent developments make the utopianism of this position even clearer.
    Israel is currently defined as the nation-state of the Jewish people rather
    than of its citizens, leaving its non-Jewish residents to sit at the back of
    the bus. This is just one manifestation of a process whereby hard and
    far-right politics increasingly dominate every aspect of official Israeli
    society. The right has triumphed in all five elections between 2019 and
    2022, with parties competing over who could promise the most bombings and
    annexations. The current Israeli government is the most right-wing in
    history, one in which open fascists participate alongside religious zealots
    and other hard-right figures. Loewenstein aptly describes Netanyahu’s
    re-election in 2022 as “the equivalent of the KKK breaking down the door
    brandishing an assault weapon”(p.211). The anti-democratic judicial reform
    passed into law in July, which gives the government even more freedom to
    expand settlements, is just the latest expression of the natural trajectory
    of a state based on dispossession and domination.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loewenstein can hardly be blamed for not offering a clearer path forward.
    The situation is desperate. The Arab states are increasingly abandoning even
    feigned backing for Palestine, and there hasn’t been a mass revival of civil
    resistance since the 2021 Unity Intifada. Despite this, the widespread
    protests and nationwide strike of the Unity Intifada show the possibility
    for mass resistance, as did the revolutions that swept the region in 2011
    and 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite this minor criticism, Loewenstein’s book is an important weapon in
    the struggle against Israel’s occupation of Palestine, and indeed the very
    existence of Israel as an ethno-nationalist state. It should be read by all
    those with an interest in the struggle for justice and the debauched
    dealings of international weapons companies.
