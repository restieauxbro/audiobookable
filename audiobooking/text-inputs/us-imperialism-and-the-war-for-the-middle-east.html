     US imperialism and the war for the Middle East <br><br>
    Since the dramatic seizure of Mosul by Islamic State<span

    forces in June 2014, the contradictions in US Middle East policy, the
    limitations of US power and the lack of any coherent strategy have all
    become glaringly apparent. On the one hand, Obama’s plan to draw down US
    engagement in the Middle East in order to focus on Asia is no longer viable.
    The US cannot disengage from the Middle East without suffering a severe blow
    to its status as the world’s dominant imperial power. On the other hand, the
    fallout from the failed occupation of Iraq and the radical realignment of
    forces in the years since the 2011 Arab uprising have combined to severely
    limit the ability of the US to intervene. Obama’s campaign to “degrade and
    destroy” the Islamic State is at best an exercise in wishful thinking. No
    credible argument has been put forward that a US air campaign without a
    substantial commitment of ground forces will do anything to push back the
    Islamic State or advance US strategic interests. But Obama has no stomach
    for a new invasion of Iraq. This reluctance is the result, not of some
    peacenik liberalism, but of the ever present memory, in both ruling class
    circles and the US population as a whole, of the painful consequences of the
    2003 invasion and its aftermath.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unable and unwilling to intervene directly in a decisive manner, the US has
    attempted to enlist the help of various regional forces. But the region’s
    major players – most importantly Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran – show little
    interest in being proxies for US power, and are instead focused on a bitter
    struggle among themselves to assert influence in a changing geopolitical
    landscape. Attempts by the US to broker a rapprochement with Iran, led by US
    Secretary of State John Kerry, have met with fierce opposition from Saudi
    Arabia. Israel, supposedly the closest ally of the US in the region, is
    likewise hostile to a deal between the US and Iran. Saudi Arabia and Turkey
    have both demanded that the US take real action to facilitate the overthrow
    of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. But the US is hamstrung by its reliance on Iran
    – a key Assad backer – to prop up the anti-IS forces in Iraq.
  </p>
  <p>
    These contradictions have led not only to a vacillating US policy but also
    to a major debate in the US establishment about the fundamentals of its
    Middle East policy. The White House has been pursuing talks with Iran and
    views favourably the prospect of a major reconciliation over the next few
    years, ending the hostilities that have existed, with various levels of
    intensity, since the 1979 revolution. Others reject any compromise with Iran
    and argue that the US should intervene to help topple the Assad regime in
    Syria.
  </p>
  <p>
    This complex situation is a reflection of the marked decline in US imperial
    power over the last decade. The US remains the world’s only true global
    power. It is the only nation capable of projecting force anywhere on the
    planet. But it is no longer unchallengeable or unchallenged.

  <h2>The Iraq war and the decline of US power</h2>
  <p>
    The US emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union in a position of
    unprecedented strength. Militarily it was vastly superior, spending more on
    arms than the rest of the world combined. Economically the US had declined
    from its overwhelmingly dominant position at the end of World War II and
    during the postwar boom, but it still accounted for about 32 percent of the
    world economy in 2003, giving it a significant advantage over its rivals.
    But if the US did not face serious short term threats to its hegemony, the
    medium to long term position remained unpredictable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Iraq war was meant to be the opening play in a new strategy to ensure
    continued US global hegemony, underpinned by the ability of the US to
    dominate the world by virtue of its overwhelming military power. The key
    architects of this approach were grouped around the Project for the New
    American Century (PNAC), a think tank established in 1997 in an effort to
    provide a long term strategy that would prevent the rise of what it termed a
    “peer competitor”. There was no guarantee, the PNAC argued, that the
    unipolar world that emerged out of the collapse of the USSR would endure.
    Unchallenged US domination would prove fleeting if it did not aggressively
    take advantage of its temporary dominance to set in place the conditions for
    long term hegemony.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outlook of the PNAC was set out in a report that John Pilger described
    as “a blueprint of American aims in all but name”.<span

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      America should seek to preserve and extend its position of global
      leadership by maintaining the pre-eminence of US military forces. Today,
      the United States has an unprecedented strategic opportunity. It faces no
      immediate great-power challenge; it is blessed with wealthy, powerful and
      democratic allies in every part of the world; it is in the midst of the
      longest economic expansion in its history; and its political and economic
      principles are almost universally embraced. At no time in history has the
      international security order been as conducive to American interests and
      ideals. The challenge for the coming century is to preserve and enhance
      this “American peace”. Yet unless the United States maintains sufficient
      military strength, this opportunity will be lost.<span

  <p>
    There was a messianic element to much of their thinking. Richard Perle,
    arguing for a strategy of “total war”, said:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      No stages… We are fighting a variety of enemies. There are lots of them
      out there. All this talk about first we are going to do Afghanistan, then
      we will do Iraq…is entirely the wrong way to go about it. If we just let
      our vision of the world go forth, and we embrace it entirely and we don’t
      try to piece together clever diplomacy, but just wage a total war…our
      children will sing great songs about us years from now.<span

  <p>
    The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington DC on 11 September 2001
    were the opportunity the neocons had been waiting for. Investigative
    reporter for <em>The</em> <em>New Yorker</em> Nicholas Lemann described how
    Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush’s most senior adviser, told him that in the
    wake of 9/11:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      [S]he had called together the senior staff people of the National Security
      Council and asked them to think seriously about “how do you capitalize on
      these opportunities” to fundamentally change American doctrine, and the
      shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. “I really think this
      period is analogous to 1945 to 1947”, she said – that is, the period when
      the containment doctrine took shape – “in that the events so clearly
      demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it’s a big global
      threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of
      as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the tectonic plates
      in international politics. And it’s important to try to seize on that and
      position American interests and institutions and all of that before they
      harden again.”<span class="floating-ref-link"

  <p>
    The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are sometimes portrayed as the result of
    the neocons, a particular faction of the US ruling class (or more narrowly,
    a particular faction of the Republican Party), hijacking US foreign policy.
    But this ignores the fact that the Iraq war had overwhelming support among
    all the institutions of the US establishment. The events of 9/11 had enabled
    PNAC to win the argument about the possibility and the necessity of a new
    era of US military assertiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the immediate aftermath of the fall of Baghdad, the hawks in the Bush
    administration were triumphant. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
    arrogantly strutted the Middle East threatening war on Syria, talked of a
    blockade of North Korea and issued veiled threats against Iran. As part of
    Rumsfeld’s plans, the US moved troops from Germany to Poland, Bulgaria,
    Romania and Hungary to surround Russia. US defence analyst John Pike gloated
    about the global spread of US forces: “If you want to talk about suns never
    setting on Empires…the Brits had nothing compared to this.” But after just a
    few short months of occupation, the mood in Washington changed. Leading
    figures on the right of US politics began to fear a calamity. William
    Kristol and Robert Kagan, two of the most prominent neo-conservative
    ideologues, editorialised in <em>The Weekly Standard </em>on 1 September
    2003:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The future course of American foreign policy, American world leadership
      and American security is at stake. Failure in Iraq would be a devastating
      blow to everything the United States hopes to accomplish and must
      accomplish in the decades ahead.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a title="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="reference-body-link"
          >6</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    These fears were realised in the years that followed, as the US became
    bogged down in a gruelling and bloody occupation, facing a determined Iraqi
    resistance movement. By August 2004 Robert Fisk was able to write:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Much of Iraq has fallen outside the control of America’s puppet
      government… Hundreds of attacks are made against US troops every month. I
      drive down to Najaf. Highway 8 is one of the worst in Iraq. It is littered
      with burnt-out police vehicles and American trucks. Every police post for
      70 miles has been abandoned. The American-appointed “government” controls
      only parts of Baghdad – and even there its ministers and civil servants
      are car-bombed and assassinated. Baquaba, Samara, Kut, Mahmoudiya, Hilla,
      Fallujah, Ramadi, all are outside government authority. Iyad Allawi, the
      “Prime Minister”, is little more than mayor of Baghdad.<span

        ></span

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    As the war dragged on and the US death toll rose, opposition at home became
    more entrenched. By 2005 retired Army Lt. Gen. William Odom was describing
    the Iraq war as “the greatest strategic disaster in US history”.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a title="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="reference-body-link"
        >8</a
      ></span
    >
    The neocons’ grand plans lay in ruins, and all that was left was to manage a
    US withdrawal in such a way as to minimise the strategic damage to US power.
    Ironically, the biggest winner of the Iraq occupation was the Iranian
    regime. The overthrow of Saddam Hussein not only removed a regional
    competitor with whom Iran had fought a long and bloody war but also left
    Iraq weak, divided and open to significant Iranian influence. Furthermore,
    it destroyed the neocon dream of expanding US regime change operations to
    Tehran. And with the US bogged down in Iraq, rivals like China and Russia
    were able to project their own power with limited US opposition: into
    Eastern Europe in Russia’s case, and South-East Asia, Africa and Latin
    America in the case of China. The global economic crisis that began in 2008
    further underlined the shifting plates of global power. Between 2007 and
    2012, the advanced economies grew by 3 percent, the emerging and developing
    countries by 31 percent, and China by 51 percent.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a title="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" class="reference-body-link"
        >9</a

    >
    The extraordinary rise of China is reflected in both its rate of growth – as
    Ashley Smith has pointed out, 30 years ago its economy was smaller than the
    Netherlands’,<span class="floating-ref-link"

    >
    and it is now the second biggest economy in the world and projected to
    overtake the US within 20 years – and also its growing strategic weight in
    the global economic system, a point underlined by China’s now acknowledged
    role as banker to the US government.
  </p>
  <p>
    The significant ruling class backing for Barack Obama in the 2008 election
    was recognition of the failure of the “Bush doctrine” of American
    unilateralism. Obama’s plan to “pivot to Asia” was an attempt to cut US
    losses in the Middle East and rebuild after the Iraq debacle. But ongoing
    instability in Iraq and the momentous uprising across the Arab world in 2011
    made such a reorientation impossible.
  </p>
  <h2>The great rupture</h2>
  <p>
    The seeming omnipotence of US imperialism in 2003 was not simply a product
    of the overwhelming military power it brought to bear in Iraq. The second
    crucial factor was the absence of any force in the Arab world that could
    provide an alternative to the US version of “the new Middle East”. Iraqis
    showed little interest in fighting to defend the corrupt and brutal regime
    of Saddam Hussein. Of the other Arab countries, no regime offered any
    meaningful opposition to the US invasion, and popular protests, while
    reflective of great anger, were ineffectual. In the following years, forces
    that stood in opposition to imperialist domination of the region did emerge.
    The Iraqi resistance, in both its Sunni and Shiite elements, was the most
    important of these, combining elements of a civil protest movement with a
    mass-based armed insurgency. Outside Iraq, Hezbollah’s war to drive back the
    Israeli assault on Lebanon in July 2006 electrified Arab opinion. It was the
    biggest defeat ever inflicted on Israel by an Arab army. Hezbollah leader
    Hassan Nasrallah was – justifiably – hailed as a hero across the Arab world.
  </p>
  <p>
    These struggles against invasion and occupation were entirely legitimate.
    The Iraqi resistance in particular is owed a great debt by the people of the
    world for the fact that it halted the US military in its tracks, and in
    doing so stopped countless further wars that would have been the inevitable
    result of a decisive US victory in Iraq. But there nonetheless remained
    major limitations. One, the struggles in both Iraq and Lebanon were, by
    necessity, militarised movements in which popular mobilisation and
    organisation played a secondary role. This followed the pattern that emerged
    with the second Palestinian Intifada that broke out in 2000, which (in
    response to savage Israeli repression) quickly became militarised and had
    little of the mass character and popular organisation of the first Intifada
    that had begun in 1987. The second limitation was that these struggles,
    focused by necessity on the “external” enemy of Western imperialism, did not
    directly challenge the other key and in many ways more intractable pillar of
    reaction across the region – the corrupt Arab ruling classes and the
    despotic regimes with which they are intertwined.
  </p>
  <p>
    All this changed with the Arab revolution of 2011. From one end of the Arab
    world to the other, millions of people rose up in revolt. It was a movement
    without precedent in the Middle East for its scale and spread, a genuine
    mass uprising that in a few short weeks overturned dictators, threw the Arab
    ruling classes and their imperialist patrons into complete disarray and
    opened a new epoch in Arab politics and society, the final outcome of which
    will still not be known for many years. Leon Trotsky famously defined
    revolution as “the entry of the masses into the realm of rulership over
    their own destiny”. In January, February and March of 2011, the world got a
    glimpse of what this means as heroic young people took to the streets in
    defiance of tear gas, batons and bullets, determined to chart a new future
    for themselves and their countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Arab uprising reframed the entire political discourse in the Middle
    East. There had always been a link between the struggle against imperialism
    and opposition to the Arab dictatorships. Even those rulers who mouthed
    opposition to US imperialism and support for the Palestinians were quick to
    put down any actual agitation against imperialism or in solidarity with the
    Palestinian struggle, as they knew the potential for anti-imperialist
    movements to morph into resistance to the regimes that were intimately tied
    to the system of imperialist domination and capitalism across the region.
    But the Arab uprising was unique in that its great slogan in almost every
    country, “the people want the overthrow of the regime”, directly challenged
    the system of political and economic power in every Arab country. More than
    that, in a region where oppositional struggle had for so long been the
    preserve of armed groups, or of political organisations tied to one or
    another of the Arab regimes, this was a mass popular uprising, a rebellion
    that united people in struggle across sectarian, political, religious and
    national lines against the authoritarian regimes and the super-rich elite in
    whose interests they ruled. The revolt did, of course, as is the case with
    all genuinely mass democratic uprisings, draw in significant sections of the
    middle class. But it was driven by young people, workers, students and the
    poor, and was centred not only on democracy but also on demands for social
    justice and the redistribution of wealth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Among the millions on the streets, there was no shortage of hostility to US
    imperialism or support for the Palestinian cause. In Cairo after the fall of
    Mubarak, thousands of Palestinian flags flew at demonstrations in Tahrir
    Square in solidarity with young Palestinians in the Golan Heights and the
    West Bank battling Israeli troops on the anniversary of the <em>nakba</em>.
    But as people rose up with the same slogans and demands against both the
    openly pro-Western regimes in Egypt, Yemen and Tunisia, and against the
    leaders of the so-called “anti-imperialist front” like Bashar al-Assad in
    Syria, the real fault lines of Arab politics became clear. No longer was the
    divide between the warring band of brothers at the top of Arab society, each
    aligned in their own way to the conflicting blocs of regional and global
    politics. The uprising posed a new division: the mass of the Arab people on
    the one side, and the ruling Arab elites, the rich and the imperialists of
    all stripes on the other.
  </p>
  <p>
    This new dynamic posed a challenge not only to the ruling regimes, but also
    to the resistance movements of the region – most importantly Hezbollah and
    Hamas, but also the other Islamist, nationalist and leftist political forces
    whose identity was closely wrapped up with opposition to imperialism, but
    were also connected to one or another regional regime. As long as they were
    fighting Israel, the contradictions inherent in both resisting elements of
    the regional capitalist system and also being intertwined with other
    elements of it, could remain in the background. A new region-wide popular
    movement against all of the established ruling elites brought those
    contradictions to the fore.
  </p>
  <h2>The US response to the Arab uprising</h2>
  <p>
    The “Arab Spring”, to use the name most favoured in the West, posed a severe
    challenge to US strategic interests. Already severely weakened by its
    failure in Iraq, the US was thrown into chaos by the stunning speed of the
    revolt, which in a few short weeks tore apart a regional order that had
    taken many decades to construct. As Gilbert Achcar wrote:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The Arab uprising exploded in [a] context marked by the advanced
      decomposition of American hegemony over the region. What is more, it began
      by deeply destabilising a pair of states that are US allies, one of which
      is also its principal Arab military partner. Two of the oldest Arab
      friends of Western governments fell. With movements springing up in
      virtually all the countries in the region, three more US allies had to
      face uprisings in their turn: Yemen, Bahrain and Libya. The US found
      itself in the position of a captain who has lost control of his ship in a
      raging sea. In such circumstances, it does no good to toil against wind
      and waves; one is better advised to go with the flow than to resist at the
      risk of sinking the ship.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a title="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" class="reference-body-link"
          >11</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After initial hesitation, Obama and his administration publicly positioned
    themselves in support of the revolution. But they were in a bind. It was one
    thing to recognise that Ben Ali and Mubarak were lost causes, and that it
    was necessary to grant reforms to avoid a much greater conflagration. But on
    a fundamental level, the US could not tolerate real Arab democracy, which is
    completely counterposed to US interests in the Middle East. One indication
    of the problem was revealed in a survey that found that in Egypt, Jordan and
    the Palestinian territories, as well as in Turkey, over three quarters of
    respondents held an unfavourable view of the United States at the time of
    the Arab Spring. And even that understates the real problem. Many Arabs
    express admiration for aspects of US society or its people, but when it
    comes to issues affecting the Middle East, almost every US policy – the war
    in Iraq, support for the Saudi monarchy, the imposition of neoliberal
    economic policies and, most of all, the unwavering US support for Israel –
    is bitterly resented. A genuinely democratic government in Egypt, Libya,
    Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria or Lebanon would be
    deeply hostile to US policy in general and Israel in particular.
  </p>
  <p>
    So while the US voiced support for the democratic demands of the protesters
    and accepted the necessity for at least some of the old rulers to be
    removed, officials and political leaders constantly emphasised the need for
    an “orderly transition” that would ensure “stability”. The general approach
    was to back the existing order as long as it seemed viable, and, once it
    didn’t, to look for the smoothest transition that would keep as much of the
    existing state as possible in place and ensure a new regime that Washington
    could work with.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is notable that the US approach was markedly different from that of its
    closest regional ally, Israel, which was much more overtly hostile to the
    democratic revolt and reluctant to accede to a policy that accepted change.
    The former Israeli ambassador in Cairo described the potential fall of the
    Mubarak regime as “a horrible scenario” and “a disaster for Israel, Jordan,
    Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, Europe and the US”.<span

    Israeli hostility was not reserved for the movements against the explicitly
    pro-Western regimes. With regard to Syria, Efraim Halevy, who served as
    chief of Mossad from 1998 to 2002, wrote:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Israel knows one important thing about the Assads: for the past 40 years,
      they have managed to preserve some form of calm along the border.
      Technically, the two countries have always been at war – Syria has yet to
      officially recognize Israel – but Israel has been able to count on the
      governments of Hafez and Bashar Assad to enforce the Separation of Forces
      Agreement from 1974, in which both sides agreed to a cease-fire in the
      Golan Heights, the disputed vantage point along their shared border.
      Indeed, even when Israeli and Syrian forces were briefly locked in fierce
      fighting in 1982 during Lebanon’s civil war, the border remained
      quiet.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  <p>
    If there is any clearer indictment of the Assad regime’s supposed
    “anti-imperialist” credentials, I would like to hear it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The US role in the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya looks, on the face
    of it, to be an example of a more interventionist US approach than that
    adopted in Egypt, Syria and Yemen. The US and NATO were involved in
    extensive bombing, and the result was not just the fall of Gaddafi but also
    the collapse of the Libyan state. But the eventual outcome in Libya was, in
    fact, precisely the situation the US was trying to avoid. Libya had been a
    Western ally since 2003. Western oil companies such as the Italian ENI, the
    British BP, the French Total and GDF Suez and the US companies
    ConocoPhillips, Hess and Occidental all had substantial investments in the
    country. The US sold and facilitated the sale of weapons to the regime, and
    had been complicit in handing over Libyan opponents of the regime to
    Gaddafi’s torturers. The US approach to the revolt was, as elsewhere, based
    on an ability to read the writing on the wall and an attempt to facilitate a
    transition of power that would be the least disruptive to Western interests.
    Although, unlike in Syria, this involved military action, the US policy of
    refusing to arm the Syrian rebels mirrored its approach in Libya. The
    failure of the bombing campaign to achieve its objective of removing Gaddafi
    from power while leaving the core of the Libyan state intact has since been
    used as one of the key arguments against providing military support – even
    air support – to Syrian rebel groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major exception to the US policy of “orderly transition” was in Bahrain.
    When protests broke out on 14 February 2011, they were immediately met with
    harsh repression. As in Egypt and elsewhere, this sparked further
    resistance: the occupation of public squares, and in March a general strike
    that was joined by 60 percent of the workforce. But the Bahrain uprising had
    a great disadvantage when compared with Egypt and Tunisia – the proximity of
    the foundational pillar of Arab reaction, Saudi Arabia. The Saudi monarchy
    was prepared to do whatever it took to prevent the Gulf states succumbing to
    the regional upheaval, and dispatched troops to Bahrain who were key to
    eventually putting down the revolt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not a word of protest about freedom and democracy came from the White House.
    As far as Obama was concerned, rhetoric about the righteousness of
    democratic uprisings was advisable only when the US could do nothing to stop
    them from happening. When the US’s closest Arab ally was on hand to bloodily
    suppress a revolt, silent consent – the decades-long US attitude to Arab
    authoritarianism – continued to carry the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Bahrain example, aside from exposing US hypocrisy, also highlights US
    weakness in the face of the Arab uprising. The US military, for all its
    firepower, could not intervene to defend its friends in Egypt or Tunisia.
    The world’s greatest superpower was relegated to the role of adviser to the
    powers behind Mubarak and Ben Ali on how best to accept the inevitable. The
    Saudis proved in Bahrain that they were much more capable of intervening
    outside their borders to defend the old order, something that they were to
    demonstrate again in the coming years.

  <h2>Contours of the Arab counter-revolution</h2>
  <p>
    Four years after the Arab uprising began, the exhilaration of those early
    days is a distant memory. The old order struck back hard, leaving the region
    bloodied beyond all recognition. In Egypt, the symbolic centre of the
    rebellion, military rule has been restored. The regime in Syria has more
    than made good on its terrible promise, “Assad, or the country burns”. The
    Saudi monarchy remains intact and has used its vast resources to help stymie
    rebellion in the Gulf countries and beyond. The US played a role in the
    counter-revolution from the start. But it was far from the only, or even the
    most important, reactionary force. The three centres of the regional
    counter-revolution were the Egyptian military, the Saudi monarchy and, in a
    slightly different way, the Syrian regime. All pursued a strategy that,
    while at times intersecting with the strategic orientation of the US, was
    fundamentally independent of it. Contrary to the view often put forward on
    the left, it was not US imperialism but the Arab regimes that played the
    leading role in destroying the democratic and social aspirations manifest in
    the Arab revolution.
  </p>
  <h3>Egypt and Saudi Arabia</h3>
  <p>
    The Egyptian military is the backbone of political and economic power in
    Egypt. Since Nasser it has been the key state institution, and it controls
    around a third of the economy – including investment in non-military sectors
    like tourism, food production, pharmaceuticals and light industry. For the
    most part, the military has exercised control indirectly, which has been an
    important factor in maintaining its image as “protector of the nation”. The
    ousting of Mubarak on 11 February 2011 was a coldly calculated move by the
    military leadership to maintain the Egyptian power structure. Proclaiming
    itself the agent of the popular revolutionary will, it suspended the
    constitution, dissolved the legislature and took power in the name of the
    Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). That this move could meet with
    widespread approval indicated the depth of illusions in the military
    throughout Egyptian society, including in most of the vanguard sections of
    the revolutionary movement. But from the moment it took power, SCAF began to
    reveal its true agenda, stoking sectarian tensions against Christian Copts,
    denouncing workers demanding pay rises and the removal of
    <em>feloul</em> elements of management and attacking – first with words,
    then with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition – anyone who dared to
    take to the streets and squares of Egyptian cities to insist that the
    demands of the revolution be met.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key ally of the military in containing and winding back the revolution
    was the Saudi monarchy, headed by King Abdullah. As the Marxist writer Adam
    Hanieh outlines in <em>Lineages of Revolt,</em> Saudi capital has played an
    increasingly important role in the Egyptian economy over the past decade.
    The share of Gulf capital in Egypt’s foreign direct investment rose from
    just 4.5 percent in 2005 to over 25 percent in 2007. From 2000 to 2008, Gulf
    investment accounted for around 37 percent of the value of all of the
    privatisation deals done as part of Mubarak’s neoliberal reforms. Just one
    area – the selling off of state-owned land to private investors – gives a
    sense of the scale of Gulf investment. One of the largest land auctions in
    Egyptian history, in May 2007, sold 90 percent of the 18.5 million square
    metres of Cairo land that was up for sale to Saudi, Qatari and UAE
    companies.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Hanieh writes:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In all of Egypt’s key economic sectors, privatisation acted to facilitate
      the replacement or merging of Egyptian capital with that of the Gulf –
      giving the latter a central position in the reproduction of capitalism at
      the national scale.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  <p>
    This huge injection of Saudi capital played a crucial role in providing
    backbone to the Egyptian counter-revolution. As Egyptian Marxist Sameh
    Naguib writes:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      [T]he absolute support given to the counterrevolution and its field
      marshal by the kings and princes of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait does not
      simply express their instinctive fear of the revolution in general, but it
      is also the outcome of Mubarak’s neoliberal policies as well as the direct
      intervention of the ruling class of the Gulf monarchies into the Egyptian
      ruling class with its corrupt businessmen and its even more corrupt
      generals.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Saudi-Emirati axis finances the field marshal’s bloody project to
      kill the Egyptian revolution to the tune of more than $20 billion, this
      reflects an interest in not only burying the revolution, but also
      continuing the policies of the Mubarak regime, which has opened a fertile
      ground for vast profits for Gulf capital in search of profitable
      investment opportunities for its accumulated oil revenues. Thus, military
      rule in Egypt today does not only represent the Egyptian ruling class, but
      a regional ruling class, in which the larger component is Gulf
      capital.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  <p>
    The Saudi role in the Arab counter-revolution should come as no surprise.
    Since the deal struck between King Saud and the US after World War II that
    cemented the growing power of the US in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has
    used its petrodollars to intervene in the politics of the region – resisting
    the nationalist movements of the 1950s and ’60s, containing the
    Palestinians, and opposing any attempt at a radical transformation of the
    region.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the early stages of the US-Saudi alliance, the Saudis were very much the
    minor player, although the huge strategic advantage the partnership gave the
    US meant the Saudis were never simply a client state, as the OPEC oil crisis
    of 1973 attests. But the enormous development of Saudi capital over the last
    quarter century, and the diversification that has both reduced its reliance
    on oil and deepened its economic penetration into the broader Arab economy,
    mean that even though the alliance with the US is still of crucial
    importance, the Saudi regime is able to act as an independent power more
    than ever before.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the wake of the Arab uprising, the Saudis aggressively pursued their own
    strategy, which was sharply at odds with that of the US, to wind back the
    revolt and restabilise the region. The key divergence was illustrated by the
    question of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. The US saw the Brotherhood as
    having a crucial role – perhaps the decisive role – in using its credentials
    as an oppositional force to contain and coopt the revolution without
    fundamentally altering the pre-revolutionary social and economic order. The
    Saudis, on the other hand, have adopted an increasingly hostile attitude to
    the Brotherhood over the last four years, culminating in King Abdullah’s
    enthusiastic support for the ousting of Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi
    from the prime ministership in 2013 and the subsequent massacres and
    imprisonment of tens of thousands of Brotherhood members.
  </p>
  <p>
    The divergence in the US and Saudi attitudes to the Brotherhood goes back
    some time. For many decades, the Saudi monarchy was the Brotherhood’s key
    patron, in spite of differences over the 1979 Iranian revolution. As a
    result, the US also had a longstanding connection to the Brotherhood. But
    when Saudi Arabia backed the US war on Saddam Hussein in 1991, and stationed
    thousands of US troops on Saudi soil, the relationship with the Brotherhood
    broke apart. As Stéphane Lacroix explained:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Several Brotherhood branches openly criticized the US military presence in
      Saudi Arabia called for by King Fahd, while the [Brotherhood-linked] Sahwa
      launched its own domestic campaign to demand radical political reforms
      including several unusually direct open letters to the king. By 1994 to
      1995, the regime had crushed this campaign, but continued to harbor a deep
      resentment toward the Brotherhood, which it held responsible for this
      unprecedented episode of dissent… In 2002, in a rare display of anger
      against the organization, Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, then
      minister of interior, openly accused the Muslim Brotherhood of being the
      “source of all evils in the Kingdom”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a title="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" class="reference-body-link"
          >17</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Over the next few years, Qatar replaced Saudi Arabia as the key patron of
    the Brotherhood. Of all the Gulf states, Qatar is the most adept at playing
    two sides at once. (Qatar also serves as the forward headquarters for the US
    Central Command and is the only Gulf state to have official trading
    relations with Israel.) Through the connection with Qatar, relations between
    the Brotherhood and the US thawed considerably by the early 2000s, and when
    the US invaded Iraq (again) in 2003, the Brotherhood’s Iraqi organisation,
    the Iraqi Islamic Party, was the main Sunni organisation to collaborate with
    the occupiers, sitting on the occupation-controlled Iraqi Governing Council.
  </p>
  <p>
    This history goes some way to explaining why, in the wake of the Arab
    revolution, the US saw the Muslim Brotherhood as capable of playing a key
    stabilising role. As a result, the relationship between the Obama
    administration and the Egyptian military, which never shifted from its
    hostile attitude to the Brotherhood, was decidedly rocky in the period of
    SCAF rule. White House officials made numerous statements imploring SCAF
    leader Mohamed Hussein Tantawi to move toward civilian rule. In November
    2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      If, over time, the most powerful political force in Egypt remains a
      roomful of unelected officials, they will have planted the seeds for
      future unrest, and Egyptians will have missed a historic opportunity… When
      unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business of
      governing, [the United States expects them] to lay out a clear road map
      and abide by it.<span class="floating-ref-link"

      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    When Mohamed Morsi finally took office in June 2012, the US welcomed the
    move. White House officials reported that, in a phone call with Morsi,
    President Obama
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      underscored that the United States will continue to support Egypt’s
      transition to democracy and stand by the Egyptian people as they fulfil
      the promise of their revolution. He emphasized his interest in working
      together with President-elect Morsi, on the basis of mutual respect, to
      advance the many shared interests between Egypt and the United
      States.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The US orientation to the Brotherhood was not confined to Egypt. When the
    Ennahda movement, unofficially the Muslim Brotherhood’s Tunisian
    organisation, took power after elections in October 2011, this was welcomed
    by the US. This followed a meeting earlier in the year in Washington, where
    Ennahda leaders met with State Department officials and congressional
    leaders, including John McCain. According to an article in <em>The</em>
    <em>Wall Street Journal:</em>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      US officials described the visit as an opportunity to build bridges with a
      moderate Islamist party that could serve as a model for groups in other
      countries in the region.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The Saudi monarchy took a very different approach. From the beginning, it
    had no time for the US talk of “reform” or “managed transitions”, denouncing
    Egyptian and Tunisian protesters as “infiltrators” who “in the name of
    freedom of expression…spew out their hatred in destruction…inciting a
    malicious sedition”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a title="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" class="reference-body-link"
        >21</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    When Mohamed Morsi came to power in 2012, the Saudi monarchy was not openly
    hostile – indeed, Morsi’s first state visit was to the Saudi kingdom. But,
    behind the scenes, there was increasing anger. Agitation for reform in Saudi
    Arabia by the Sahwa movement raised fears that the example of Islamist
    governments could spread to Saudi Arabia – whose monarchical structure and
    Wahhabist version of Islam were starkly at odds with the Brotherhood model.
    Added to this was the fact that, while Mubarak had been a close Saudi ally,
    Morsi followed his visit to Riyadh with an official trip to Tehran, Saudi
    Arabia’s most important regional rival.
  </p>
  <p>
    Saudi Arabia tried to isolate Morsi economically and hasten his departure.
    In May 2013, just two months before the military overthrow of Morsi, the
    Egyptian finance minister complained to the Saudis that Egypt had received
    only US$1 billion of the US$3.5 billion in aid promised after Mubarak’s
    downfall. When Morsi fell, Saudi Arabia quickly promised Egypt a new aid
    package of US$5 billion, together with one from the UAE for US$3 billion and
    from Kuwait for US$4 billion.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a title="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" class="reference-body-link"
        >22</a
      ></span
    >
    The Saudis publicly opposed the US call for Sisi to reinstate the deposed
    prime minister. Two hours after Sisi took power, he received a
    congratulatory message from the Saudi king in which Abdullah noted: “[I]t is
    time to uproot this kind of strange chaos, otherwise any state or nation who
    is unable to rein in outlaws would eventually lose its dignity and honour.”
    Several weeks later he explicitly attacked Qatar (and by implication the
    US), accusing it of “fanning the fire of sedition and promoting terrorism,
    which they claim to be fighting”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a title="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" class="reference-body-link"
        >23</a
      ></span
    >
    All of this caused unrest within Saudi Arabia itself:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Fifty-six sheikhs, some of them known to be close to the Saudi Muslim
      Brotherhood, condemned the “removal of a legitimately elected president”
      and a violation of “the will of the people”. They added: “We express our
      opposition and surprise at the path taken by some countries who have given
      recognition to the coup…thereby taking part in committing a sin and an
      aggression forbidden by the laws of Islam – and there will be negative
      consequences for everyone if Egypt enters a state of chaos and civil war.”
      On Twitter, in the wake of the Aug. 14, 2013 massacre in Cairo, thousands
      of Saudis replaced their pictures with the Rabaa sign in solidarity with
      the Brothers.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a title="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" class="reference-body-link"
          >24</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This dissent only solidified the Saudi regime’s opposition to the
    Brotherhood. It immediately pledged several million dollars more in support
    of the Sisi regime. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia officially declared the
    Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation. The move came just two days
    after the kingdom, together with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain,
    withdrew its ambassador from Qatar because of Qatar’s alleged support of
    Brotherhood interference in internal politics.
  </p>
  <p>
    The split with Qatar came to a head several months later with the Israeli
    war on Gaza. Sisi and Abdullah strongly backed the Israeli assault, as they
    consider Hamas to be nothing but an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood.
    They aligned themselves with the extreme right wing in Israel, which called
    for an all-out war in Gaza – up to and including a full scale Israeli
    re-occupation. The cynical Egyptian “ceasefire” proposal was a demand for
    absolute surrender, and went beyond even the most cravenly pro-Israel
    Egyptian proposals in wars past. Instead of being a ceasefire proposal, the
    Egyptian “plan” amounted to a well-orchestrated move to give Israel
    political cover for its ground invasion of Gaza, which proceeded on schedule
    as soon as Hamas inevitably rejected it. Sisi was backed to the hilt by the
    pliant Egyptian media. Azza Sami, a writer for government daily
    <em>Al-Ahram</em>, said on Twitter: “Thank you Netanyahu, and God give us
    more men like you to destroy Hamas!” Tawfik Okasha, a presenter on the
    Al-Faraeen TV channel, said: “Gazans are not men. If they were men they
    would revolt against Hamas.” The Saudis went to extraordinary lengths to
    isolate the Brotherhood from potential sources of Arab aid. Qatar was put
    under incredible pressure to end its support for the Brotherhood. It has
    been threatened with punitive action, not just from the Saudis, but also
    from other neighbours like the United Arab Emirates, which is so hostile to
    Hamas it allegedly offered to help fund the Israeli assault on Gaza. The
    November 2014 announcement that diplomatic relations between Qatar and the
    other Gulf states have been restored indicates that Qatar has now
    substantially capitulated to this pressure.
  </p>
  <h3>The Syrian regime</h3>
  <p>
    The Egyptian military recognised that if Mubarak refused to relinquish
    power, the country would be torn apart. It had the capacity to make this
    judgment and act on it without a complete rupture of the state apparatus.
    The Syrian regime had no such choice. In Egypt the institution of the
    military, which effectively ruled the country, was stronger than any one
    individual or clique. In Syria the ruling class was intimately intertwined
    with the Assad family itself, and beyond it the Allawite elite, who
    controlled the country through an elaborate patronage system that could not
    be disentangled from loyalty to the central figures of the Assad clan.
    Because of this, the Egyptian option – a palace coup – did not exist. The
    state apparatus would stand or fall with its figurehead – the once
    considered unassuming Bashar al-Assad.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Syrian experience is a sharp lesson in the lengths the Arab state powers
    will go to to hold on to their core power. In Egypt and Tunisia, all kinds
    of concessions were initially made (most have since been withdrawn). Only in
    Syria have we seen the true extent of the lengths the old regimes will go to
    in a final defence of their rule. The results are horrifying. More than
    200,000 are dead. Almost every city outside Damascus has been reduced to
    ruins. Millions of refugees have been forced to flee to Jordan or Lebanon,
    or are internally displaced. It is a terrible thing to have to confront, but
    the regime in Syria is not uniquely evil. It is simply an illustration of
    what the ruling classes of the region are prepared to do if they think they
    have no other way to protect the core of their power from mass revolt.
  </p>
  <p>
    The desperation of the Syrian regime, though, also illuminates the approach
    taken more slowly and with more nuance by the other sections of the regional
    counter-revolution. The most important aspect of this is the relentless
    drive by the Assad forces to transform the fundamental nature of the
    struggle from a fight between a dictatorship on the one hand and a popular
    rebellion on the other, into a war between stability and Islamist terrorism.
    From the first day of the rebellion, Assad waged a battle to change the
    narrative along these lines – a propaganda war. But he also went to great
    lengths to transform reality to fit his narrative. This has been carried out
    in numerous different ways, from releasing al-Qaeda supporters from prison
    at the start of the uprising, to deliberately focusing attacks on secular
    rebels associated with the Free Syrian Army and leaving the Islamic State
    unmolested to take control of large parts of the country.
  </p>
  <p>
    The regime’s strategy has not been wholly successful in the sense that the
    rebellion continues, and tens of thousands of Free Syrian Army fighters
    continue to struggle against sectarianism and for the overthrow of the
    regime. But it is undeniable that their fighting forces have been weakened
    over the years of conflict, both by the accommodating attitude of the regime
    to the Islamist elements of the rebellion, and also by the fact that, in
    contrast to the paltry aid offered to the secular fighters by the West, the
    various Islamist groups can rely on a constant flow of money and arms from
    both state and non-state actors in the region that are hostile to the Assad
    regime but are equally opposed to a genuinely democratic Syrian revolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The success Assad had in changing the narrative of the revolt was emulated
    with great effect by Sisi after he took power in Egypt in 2013. For months,
    the Egyptian press was full of wild accusations claiming that anyone who
    opposed military rule, or even attempted to demonstrate on the streets, was
    an Islamist terrorist. What was in fact a war on the revolution was framed
    as a war on Islamist extremism and in defence of stability and national
    unity. In that sense, Assad’s contribution to the counter-revolution has
    gone well beyond the borders of Syria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Critics of the Syrian revolution on the left claim that the US has a
    fundamentally different attitude to the Syrian revolt than it had to the
    uprising against the Egyptian and Tunisian regimes – both US allies – in
    2011. There is a grain of truth in this. The fact that it was close partners
    of the US under the gun at the start of the Arab revolt coloured the
    tactical approach the US took. But on a fundamental level, the approach is
    the same. The US relationship with the Assad regime was not as close as the
    alliance with Mubarak, but the Syrian regime was a stable element in the
    region with which the US could deal – and did on numerous occasions. The
    Assad dynasty – both father and son – kept the peace on the Israeli border
    for over 40 years, and put down attempts by Palestinians and the left to
    take on Israel or install radical or genuinely pro-Palestinian governments
    on its border. The more important unique feature about Syria that dictated
    the US approach was the impossibility of disentangling the Syrian state from
    the hated dictator at its top. This meant that the US, if it was going to
    make a real choice, had either to back Assad as in Bahrain, but without a
    Saudi-style reserve army to come in and save the day, or to come out and
    help the rebellion to bring down the whole regime. The US did not consider
    either option to be palatable; the former because it would discredit the US
    and entrench Russian influence in the Middle East, the latter because it
    would require either a major US military operation, or the handing over of
    substantial numbers of arms to rebels who it knew were in no way pro-US or
    pro-Israeli. Unwilling to make a pro-active choice, the US vacillated,
    offering verbal support to the rebels, but nothing in the way of real
    weaponry or logistical support. In doing so it sent a message to the regime
    that while the US might make statements against it, there was little or no
    chance it would ever act decisively to oppose the status quo. Contrast this
    vacillating US approach with that of Russia, which has been unwavering in
    its backing of the Assad regime.
  </p>
  <h2>A new geopolitical map</h2>
  <p>
    The US withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 had none of the drama of the evacuation
    of Saigon in 1975, but it nonetheless represented a historic defeat. The
    original geopolitical goals of the invasion were a distant memory, a dream
    that died in the streets of cities like Fallujah many years before. But even
    the most negative assessment of the US position after the 2011 withdrawal
    did not predict the firestorm that was to erupt over the next three years,
    as the sectarian war waged by the Maliki government led to a Sunni
    rebellion, the rise of the Islamic State and the fracturing of Iraq as it
    became absorbed into the battleground of a wider regional war.
  </p>
  <p>
    The seizure of Mosul was significant not just because it signalled the rise
    of the Islamic State as a transnational military organisation that had
    effectively obliterated the Iraq-Syria border and now controlled a vast
    territory in the heart of the Middle East. It also demonstrated as farce the
    idea that the Iraqi military was capable of holding together a fractured
    country. The collapse of military units supposedly over 20,000 strong told
    the world what most Iraqis already knew – that the military was more a
    racket for enriching the corrupt officer class than a fighting force. The
    rout in Mosul announced what had in effect already taken place – the
    break-up of Iraq along sectarian and ethnic lines, with a Shiite government
    in Baghdad and the south, an essentially autonomous Kurdish region in the
    north and a vast and contested Sunni belt in the centre and west of the
    country and across the border into Syria.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Obama announced that the US would engage in military action against the
    Islamic State, he was not, as many supposed, signalling the beginning of a
    major new US war on Iraq. His insistence that there would be no deployment
    of ground troops – the only possible way to assert a serious measure of
    control over the situation – indicated that the bombing campaign was more
    about the need to be seen to do something than actually to do anything. But
    instead of indicating the continued ability of the US to project power into
    the region, the limited bombing campaign only revealed US weakness. Most US
    military strategists are of the view that a campaign to defeat IS and
    reunite Iraq would require the deployment of several hundred thousand
    troops, probably for a number of years. But as soon as the question is posed
    in those terms, the reality of the situation becomes obvious. The US is in
    no position to launch such a venture. No US president will be able to muster
    the political support required for a large scale return to Iraq. It may be
    that the US will eventually be dragged into a ground war that requires the
    deployment of significant numbers of troops, but if it does so it will be
    reluctantly and gradually, and as a result ineffectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deprived of the option of decisive independent action, the US has been
    forced to act as air support for the forces actually fighting the Islamic
    State on the ground – the Kurds in the north and, more problematically for
    the US, the Iranian-backed Shiite militias and Iranian Revolutionary Guard
    troops who are defending Baghdad and the south and attempting to push the
    Islamic State back in the cities to the west of Baghdad and up the Tigris
    river. This new US-Iranian alliance, a necessity if the US is not to abandon
    Iraq altogether, has created strong hostility among US regional allies –
    particularly Saudi Arabia and Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Saudi Arabia has long been of the view that Iran is the only regional power
    with the ability to rival its leading role in the Middle East. Saudi foreign
    policy is animated by the fear of an unbroken “Shia crescent” stretching
    from Iran to the Mediterranean, controlling the Arab heartlands of
    Mesopotamia and the Levant. For this reason, it has viewed the rise of
    Iranian influence in Iraq, previously a buffer against Iran, with grave
    concern over the past few years. Saudi Arabia is also paranoid about the
    potential influence of Iran over discontented Shia populations in Bahrain
    and Yemen, as well as among the substantial Shia minority in Saudi Arabia
    itself, which is concentrated in the oil-producing areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    This does not mean, as some have presumed, that the Saudi regime supports
    the Islamic State. The Islamic State views the Saudi monarchy as an
    illegitimate, apostate regime, and has openly declared itself committed to
    its overthrow. This is unlikely, but a Wahhabi jihadist uprising in the
    kingdom is not beyond the bounds of possibility, particularly if the Islamic
    State were to continue its expansion and make serious inroads in Lebanon or,
    more seriously, Jordan. But although it does not support the Islamic State,
    the Saudi regime is hostile to the expansion of Shiite power in Iraq, which
    puts it at odds with the US campaign in defence of the Baghdad government.
  </p>
  <p>
    The centre of Saudi Arabia’s Iran containment policy, though, is in Syria.
    While a bitter enemy of the Arab uprising in general, the Saudi regime saw
    the armed conflict between Bashar al-Assad and the assorted revolutionary
    groupings as an opportunity to unseat the Iranians’ key Arab ally, which
    would in turn substantially hinder Iranian support for Hezbollah in Lebanon.
    Of course the Saudis were not the slightest bit interested in a truly
    democratic Syria, and indeed would consider that a much worse and more
    destabilising outcome than Assad remaining in power. For this reason, Saudi
    funding of rebel groups has been targeted at the most sectarian (other than
    IS) of the resistance groups, and with the aim of establishing a patronage
    system that maximises Saudi influence in a post-Assad Syria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2012, the Saudis have expressed growing frustration over the refusal
    of the US to give meaningful support to the anti-Assad forces in Syria. This
    has accelerated considerably since the US bombing campaign in Iraq and the
    more open rapprochement with Iran, which is manifest in both military
    cooperation in Iraq, and progress in the ongoing talks about resolving the
    conflict over Iran’s nuclear program. The extension of these talks into 2015
    was accompanied by clear signals from US officials, and from Secretary of
    State John Kerry, that the US was serious about reaching a resolution. The
    reality appears to be that the real stumbling block to an agreement is
    Iran’s belief that the bargaining position of the US is deteriorating, and
    it is in its interests to hold out for an even better deal down the track.
  </p>
  <p>
    Turkey, like Saudi Arabia, is hostile to the Assad regime, having committed
    itself to supporting the rebels from very early in the conflict. Turkey has
    refused to offer meaningful support to the US campaign against Islamic State
    unless the US commits to taking on Assad. Its refusal to offer any support
    to the Kurdish fighters resisting Islamic State fighters who besieged the
    town of Kobane, near the Turkish border, was a result not only of Turkey’s
    bitter opposition to the emergence of an autonomous Kurdish enclave on its
    border, but also flowed from Turkey’s broader concern that the campaign
    against the Islamic State was only strengthening the hand of the Assad
    regime and weakening the moderate Islamist groups backed by Turkey. While
    Turkey is at one with Saudi Arabia in its opposition to Assad, it is a
    deeply uneasy alliance. Just as the Saudi regime aims to lay the basis for a
    post-Assad Syria in its sphere of influence, so Turkey wants to project
    itself into Syria, which it sees as a crucial launching pad for the
    reassertion of Turkish influence in the Arab world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The US is in a bind. Its original Syria policy was to push for a negotiated
    settlement that removed Assad and introduced some level of democratisation,
    but left the state intact – essentially the same policy it pursued in Egypt
    and Yemen. But because of the different structure of the Syrian ruling
    class, and the resultant decision of the regime to fight to the death – with
    Bashar at the helm – this policy was utopian and unrealisable. As a result,
    US policy has increasingly become dictated not by what the US wants in
    Syria, but by what the other regional players want. Saudi Arabia and Iran,
    and also Turkey and to a lesser extent Israel, do have Syria policies –
    feasible and actionable ones. The problem for the US – which seeks alliances
    with all of them in varied degree – is that the policies of the regional
    powers are not only at odds with each other, but are in fact directed at
    gaining geopolitical advantage at the expense of each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    The divisions and debates in the US establishment over its Middle East
    policy are a result of these objective difficulties and limited options.
    There are still those – like Senator John McCain and PNAC founder Robert
    Kagan – who dream of a new era of US assertiveness that can be brought about
    by sheer willpower and determination. Kagan writes:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      If a breakdown in the world order that America made is occurring, it is
      not because America’s power is declining – America’s wealth, power, and
      potential influence remain adequate to meet the present challenges. It is
      not because the world has become more complex and intractable – the world
      has always been complex and intractable. And it is not simply
      war-weariness. Strangely enough, it is an intellectual problem, a question
      of identity and purpose.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a title="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" class="reference-body-link"
          >25</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Figures like Kagan and McCain are apoplectic about the negotiations with
    Iran over its nuclear program, and critical of what they see as Obama’s
    insufficiently assertive policy in Ukraine. They favour a policy in Syria of
    arming non-jihadist rebel forces and are highly critical of the
    administration’s policy paralysis with regard to the Assad regime. It may be
    that after the next presidential election the neocons – who in any case
    Obama never banished from his administration – will be back in the
    ascendency. Hillary Clinton, likely the next president, has a reputation as
    a foreign policy hawk and enjoys the confidence of many in the neocon camp.
    But there are major problems faced by those who want to assert a new era of
    US militarism. Geopolitical strategy has to be based on a realistic
    assessment of the balance of forces. The decline of US power – economically,
    militarily and geostrategically – cannot be wished away. And even if the
    objective position of the US was stronger, the disastrous legacy of the Iraq
    war looms over every policy debate as a devastating example of the dangers
    of US overreach. In any case, it is much easier to construct grand utopian
    schemes when you are not the one responsible for implementing them. It is
    unlikely to be a coincidence that, while Obama has been willing to place
    hawkish intellectuals and politicians into senior posts in his
    administration, the overall direction of US policy – guided by cautious use
    of US power and an attempt to reconstruct a new alliance that, in the Middle
    East, includes Iran – has been based on a recognition of the limits of US
    power.
  </p>
  <h2>Reconceptualising politics and class in a new era</h2>
  <p>
    In the build-up to and early days of the US war on Afghanistan in 2001,
    there was a heated debate on the US and international left about what
    attitude progressive activists should take to the war. In the wake of 9/11,
    there was intense pressure to bow to the prevailing consensus that military
    action to stop terrorism was legitimate. The few on the left who opposed the
    war were denounced as “knee-jerk anti-imperialists” – dogmatists whose
    ideological rigidity prevented them from responding concretely to a
    radically changed world. Those who argued the US military was, as Martin
    Luther King put it in an earlier era, the “greatest purveyor of violence in
    the world today”, and that it was incumbent on the left to resist the orgy
    of militarism that followed 9/11, were voices in the wilderness. But
    isolated as they were in the dark days of 2001, those who stood their ground
    and insisted that the left hold on to a clear anti-imperialist position were
    vindicated many times over in the next few years. By the time of the 2003
    invasion of Iraq, tens of millions were prepared to take to the streets
    across the world in what were the biggest anti-war protests – indeed
    probably the biggest protests of any kind – in history.
  </p>
  <p>
    This great global movement was unable to stop the war, but it gave voice to
    a vital truth: US militarism was then the key reactionary factor in global
    politics. As with every anti-war or anti-colonial movement that came before
    it, recognition of this fact, while necessary, contained within it all kinds
    of problems. It led people to downplay the reactionary nature of other
    imperialist powers – both the major non-Western states, most importantly
    China and Russia, but also European powers like France and Germany that
    refused to back the US invasion for their own narrow reasons. A focus on US
    imperialism as the main enemy also tended to obscure another and more
    fundamental division across the world: the class divide between ordinary
    people and the ruling elite of each country, and the fact that the
    antagonisms between the different sections of the latter would always, in
    the final analysis, be subordinated to their common hostility to the social
    classes that each section of the global elite ruled over.
  </p>
  <p>
    But with all those caveats, it was still absolutely right and necessary for
    the international left to throw what weight it had behind the anti-war
    movement, and to champion and try to strengthen its most intransigent
    anti-imperialist wing. The left is not, tragically, strong enough to
    influence greatly the outcome of the big political battles; it has even less
    hope of determining what the terrain and the antagonisms of those struggles
    will be. We can only fight on the ground on which we find ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the two connected developments that have been outlined above – the
    decline of US power in the wake of the Iraq war, and the reshaping of the
    terrain of politics in the Middle East brought about by the Arab revolution
    – have transformed the nature of the tasks facing the left. It is still of
    crucial importance – particularly for socialists in the West – to oppose and
    expose the nefarious agenda of US imperialism, which remains the world’s
    only global imperial power and the centre of capitalist reaction. But it is
    also necessary for the left to integrate into our strategy, tactics and
    arguments an understanding of the dramatic changes in the political
    landscape that have taken place since 2003. “Knee-jerk anti-imperialism”,
    which always meant in the first instance opposition to US imperialism in
    particular, was an admirable and heroic starting point when the US was at
    the height of its power – invading Afghanistan in the name of liberal
    democracy or unleashing its “shock and awe” onslaught on Iraq. Today though,
    the old formulas do not apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    The US might be the only global power, but it is not the only imperialist
    force asserting itself in the world. Even Russia – whose economic output is
    dwarfed not only by the US and China, but also by lesser powers like Germany
    and Japan – has been aggressively advancing its interests in Ukraine, and,
    in the context of the discussion about the Middle East, in Syria. China,
    whose rise to global prominence has followed the same pattern of every great
    power before it – the consolidation of economic strength followed by
    increasing diplomatic and military assertiveness – is now posing a serious
    challenge to the global hegemony of US capital. In the Middle East, regional
    powers Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey have proven their ability to construct
    a foreign policy independent of any great power, and they are pursuing their
    own interests with as much determination and a deal more strategic clarity
    than the world’s only remaining superpower. The strategic decisions that
    each makes over the coming period will be at least as important as any
    decisions made in Washington in determining the future of the Middle East.
    And, as has been argued, it was not the US but the Arab regimes – most
    importantly Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria – that played the leading role in
    countering and containing the Arab revolution. US imperialism, for all its
    continued strength, was for the most part relegated to the role of onlooker.
  </p>
  <p>
    For these reasons alone, the international left cannot take as its starting
    point an “anti-imperialism” that simply means opposition to the US. The
    unipolar world that the ideologues of the PNAC wanted to maintain has
    vanished – the global capitalist system once again consists of competing
    powers, each of whose motives are as dubious as the next. But there is
    another factor that has transformed the global political narrative – and
    nowhere more so than in the Middle East. That is the rise of new mass
    movements that base themselves on the class antagonisms that define each
    country. The Arab revolution destroyed the old framework of imperialist
    versus anti-imperialist by basing itself on the aspirations and grievances
    of the mass of the population in every Arab country. It turned out that it
    did not matter if you lived under the pro-Western regime of Hosni Mubarak or
    the so-called anti-imperialist regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The
    grievances were the same, the motivation to revolt was the same, and, to
    different degrees, the response of the privileged ruling class was the same.
    The Arab revolt simultaneously brought the primacy of the class divisions of
    the region to the fore, putting anti-imperialism in its proper place, and
    also indicated the force that could bring down the existing order – mass
    popular revolt. In 2003 the left looked in vain for an anti-imperialist
    force that could resist the onslaught of US bombs and troops. In 2011 a
    force presented itself – the mass of the Arab working class and poor in
    revolt – that could not only shove aside the remaining power of imperialism,
    but challenge the local and in the final analysis more dangerous enemy that
    is the Arab ruling class.
  </p>
  <p>
    The defining question of today, then, in spite of the huge retreat we have
    seen in the popular movements since 2011, is not whether you support or
    reject US imperialism (although the left should continue to reject it), but
    where you stand on the Arab revolution and counter-revolution. This is a
    question that is as relevant to the traditional forces of the
    anti-imperialist resistance in the Middle East as it is to the Western left.
    In the wake of the Arab uprising, Hamas was beset by a protracted debate
    over what attitude it should take to the uprising in Syria, given that its
    external headquarters was in Damascus and it relied on military aid from
    both Syria and Iran, a key backer of the Assad regime. In the end, Hamas
    abandoned its Damascus headquarters and took a stand (if somewhat
    half-heartedly) in support of the Syrian revolt. But Hamas was nonetheless
    no enthusiast for the Arab uprising. Attempts by Egyptian activists to build
    on the revolutionary energy of 2011 by spreading the uprising to Gaza were
    met with bitter hostility. Hamas actively collaborated with SCAF in its
    attempts to prevent the revolt in Egypt spreading across the Rafah crossing
    into Gaza. Hamas had, in the wake of the overthrow of Mubarak, a historic
    opportunity to fuse the Palestinian struggle with the broader Arab revolt.
    That it rejected this opportunity out of hand is an indication of the fact
    that, whatever Hamas’s pretentions, it is more concerned to consolidate its
    own power than to put itself at the head of a broader insurrectionary Arab
    movement. But if the attitude of Hamas to the Arab revolution was
    disappointing, the stance taken by Hezbollah was a disgrace. From day one,
    Hezbollah sided with the Assad regime, putting its strategic alliance with
    Damascus and Tehran above any sympathy it might have felt for the millions
    of people rising up in resistance to dictatorship. Since then, Hezbollah has
    committed thousands of fighters to back Assad in Syria – hurting in equal
    measure the credibility and fighting capacity of its own organisation and
    the capacity of the Lebanese resistance to fight off Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Arab revolution, and the concurrent decline of US power, pose important
    questions for the international left. Is the left simply an opponent of US
    power, or do we stand with those fighting for a fundamentally different
    world order? Are we for the maintenance of the system of patronage that ties
    each resistance movement to one or another of the corrupt Arab states, or
    are we for a new movement – a continuation of the Arab revolution that
    establishes the material basis to realise the demands that pushed millions
    to revolt? Are we against the particular form of imperialism represented by
    US capitalism, or are we against the whole system of imperialist
    competition, whether practised by the aristocrats of the old imperial order
    or by the new reactionary forces of an ever evolving system? The answers we
    give to these questions will help determine the future of the left, and its
    right to claim the status it covets as the champion of revolt against
    oppression.

          The name to give the group variously known as ISIL, ISIS, Islamic
          State or Daesh is the subject of much debate. I use the term Islamic
          State on the basis that organisations have the right to name
          themselves, however offensive some might find it. For the sake of
          simplicity, Islamic State is also the name used when referring to
          actions the group took before it changed its name after the capture of
          Mosul in June 2014.
