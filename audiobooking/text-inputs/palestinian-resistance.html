      It provides vital insights into the trajectory of Palestinian resistance
      and an analysis of the different currents within the national liberation
      movement. It was written amid the turbulence of the Second Intifada, which
      signalled a deep discontent with the so-called Oslo peace process. The
      United States was publicly preparing for its illegal invasion of Iraq.
      Triggered by the events of 9/11, the (still) ongoing War on Terror was
      reshaping American empire. At the time of writing, Yasser Arafat was still
      alive and Fateh was still dominant in the movement. The Arab Spring had
      yet to unsettle and unseat dictators and despots. Despite the many
      historical moments and events that have unfolded since its original
      publication, this article provides important context for the ongoing
      revolts of the Arab Spring across the region, while making a strong case
      for why the struggle for Palestine inspires and rallies movements
      regionally.</em

    Since the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, endless rounds of negotiations
    between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel have failed
    to secure an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, a
    Palestinian state, or the right of return for five million Palestinian
    refugees. Moreover, living conditions for Palestinians in the Occupied
    Territories have actually deteriorated. Poverty and unemployment have
    skyrocketed. And Israel has expanded its settlements. As Palestinian
    professor Edward Said described the situation:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <a id="page_54"></a>In the Palestinian case, the tragedy of a dispossessed
      and militarily occupied people is compounded by a leadership that made a
      “peace” deal with its more powerful enemy, a deal that serves Israel’s
      strategic purposes by keeping Palestinians, whose land has been
      practically lost to Zionist conquest, in a state of depression and
      servitude… The fact is that by his behaviour Mr. Arafat<sup

  <p>
    In September 2000, as a result of deteriorating living conditions since Oslo
    and increasing frustration with the PLO’s political impotence, the
    Palestinians began their second mass uprising in fifteen years, the al-Aqsa
    Intifada.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref4"
          href="#_edn4"
          name="_ednref4"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >4</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    Since then, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have taken to the streets
    of the West Bank and Gaza to confront the Israeli army and settlers
    directly. Despite brutal repression by Israel and repeated attempts by
    Arafat to rein in Palestinian anger, the Palestinians have shown, once
    again, tremendous courage and willingness to make huge sacrifices to win
    their freedom.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the heroic struggles of the al-Aqsa Intifada are insufficient
    to stop Israel. The Palestinians simultaneously face a number of difficult
    obstacles: Israel’s brutal repression, unconditional US political and
    military support for Israel, betrayals and repression by the PLO itself, and
    manoeuvres by pro-US Arab regimes to end the Intifada before other Arab
    workers begin to emulate it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although formidable, these obstacles are not insurmountable. But in order
    for the Palestinians to overcome them, a mass movement needs to be built
    across the Arab world to challenge both US imperialism and the Arab regimes
    backed by it. Such a movement could provide the necessary political and
    economic support for the Palestinians to challenge Israel.

  <p>
    The success of any mass movement in challenging the US and the Arab regimes
    and supporting the Palestinians against Israel is linked to the question of
    building a socialist alternative in the Arab world. The case for this
    alternative starts from the realisation that Arab workers, who produce all
    the oil and wealth in the area, have to fight for real, democratic control
    over society in order to rid themselves of the miserable conditions imposed
    by the ruling Arab regimes and the United States.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a socialist alternative in the Arab world would have to learn from the
    mistakes of an older generation of radicals that looked to Stalinist Russia
    and certain “progressive” Arab regimes, such as Syria and Iraq, as models
    <a id="page_55"></a>for social change.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"

    This means rejecting the compromises with Zionism of the PLO; looking to the
    struggles of ordinary people in Palestine against Israel; recognising that
    solidarity with the Arab working classes, not negotiations, is the way to
    stop Israel; and fighting for a secular and democratic Palestine based on
    equality between Arabs and Jews.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building a socialist alternative in the Arab world, especially in Palestine,
    requires clarity on a number of key political questions. Why did the PLO
    surrender to Israel and Washington? Whose class interests does the PLO
    represent? Why did many Palestinians turn to Hamas? What happened to the
    Palestinian left, the Popular and the Democratic Fronts for the Liberation
    of Palestine? Why does the left tail Arafat’s policy? Is it really necessary
    (or realistic) to look to the struggles of Arab workers as the way to
    liberate Palestine?
  </p>
  <p>
    These questions cannot be properly answered without a re-examination of the
    history of the Palestinian national liberation movement, especially of the
    rise and fall of the PLO and the Palestinian left. Such a re-examination is
    necessary to achieve theoretical clarity for those of us who want to
    continue to resist both Israel and US imperialism. This essay hopes to make
    a small contribution toward that goal.
  </p>
  <h2>The pre-1948 nationalist movement</h2>
  <p>
    In the three decades that preceded the 1948 Nakba (“catastrophe”), the
    Palestinians carried out a brave struggle to resist the Zionist project of
    building a Jewish state that would serve as an outpost for Western
    imperialism in the Middle East. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the
    Palestinians challenged Britain’s colonial mandate over Palestine and its
    policy of facilitating Jewish immigration and settlement. In 1929,
    Palestinians organised demonstrations and protests against Jewish
    settlements and businesses, in what became known as the Buraq Rebellion. The
    British army viciously suppressed these protests.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref6"
          href="#_edn6"

          >6</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The intensification of Jewish immigration, triggered by the rise of fascism
    in Europe during the first half of the 1930s, placed more pressure on
    Palestinians. The Palestinians resumed the fight against British colonialism
    and Zionism, turning to armed struggle as a means of resistance. Led by the
    Muslim Brotherhood’s Sheikh Izz al-Din al-Qassam,<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref7"
          href="#_edn7"
          name="_ednref7"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >7</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    a network of militias drawn primarily from peasants and urban intellectuals
    attacked <a id="page_56"></a>British and Zionist interests all over
    Palestine. Mandate police killed al-Qassam in a gun battle in 1935, but the
    armed struggle continued.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1936, a mass social struggle joined with the armed struggle. In April,
    following weeks of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Jewish
    settlers, Arab dockworkers at the port of Jaffa struck to protest British
    support for Jewish immigration. Under mass pressure, the Palestinian elite,
    under the leadership of Jerusalem’s mufti, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, was forced
    to call a general strike. Within days, the strike spread to other major
    Palestinian ports, cities and villages. All sections of Palestinian Arab
    society, including workers, peasants, small businesses, and even sections of
    large business, joined the strike. The strike demanded an end to Jewish
    immigration, a ban on the sale of land to settlers, and the replacement of
    the British Mandate by a government drawn from the majority population.
    Palestinians organised a mass civil disobedience campaign and stopped paying
    taxes to British authorities. Meanwhile, al-Qassam militias attacked British
    and Zionist interests all over the country.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref8"
          href="#_edn8"

          class="reference-body-link"
          >8</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The general strike lasted for six months, before the British managed to end
    it with brutal repression. Armed struggle continued for two more years.
    Eventually, the British army and Zionist militias managed to crush the armed
    struggle. In total, this mass rebellion (which became known as the 1936
    Great Arab Revolt) lasted for three years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the Palestinians’ heroic struggles and sacrifices, the 1936 revolt
    failed. This was attributable to two main factors. First, the poorly armed
    Palestinian militias were no match for the overwhelming military superiority
    of the combined British and Zionist forces. Moreover, Zionist displacement
    of Palestinian workers in strategic workplaces throughout Palestine helped
    the British to “block Arab nationalist efforts to spread the general strike
    and fully paralyse the country’s economy.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref9"
          href="#_edn9"
          name="_ednref9"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >9</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    Second, fearing a total loss of control over the Palestinian masses, the
    Palestinian elite, backed by reactionary Arab regimes close to Britain,
    weakened the rebellion through its compromises with Britain and its constant
    manoeuvres to end the revolt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, the conservative role the Palestinian elite played during the 1920s
    and 1930s presented many obstacles to the development of a successful
    struggle against Zionism. This elite, composed of big landowners and
    merchants, generally opposed British colonialism and the establishment of a
    Jewish state. However, two factors mitigated this elite’s opposition to
    colonialism. On one hand, different wealthy Palestinian families competed
    <a id="page_57"></a>for support from British authorities to edge out their
    rivals. On the other hand, economic ties between the Palestinian elite as a
    whole and the other pro-British Arab ruling classes, such as those in Egypt
    and Jordan, prompted the Palestinian elite to avoid confrontation with
    Britain. This explains, for example, why some members of the elite called
    for an end to attacks on Zionist interests during the Buraq Rebellion in
    1929, or argued for a disastrous policy of strengthening relations with
    Britain to win the latter away from supporting Zionism. Some Palestinian
    notables even went so far as to argue that Britain should maintain its
    mandate over Palestine as a last line of defence against Zionism!<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref10"
          href="#_edn10"
          name="_ednref10"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >10</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, some wealthy families, such as the al-Nashashibis and al-Husseinis,
    organised different nationalist parties. However, these families aimed to
    use the nationalist struggle as a way to advance their own narrow commercial
    and political interests. Their animosity toward each other and their fear of
    the masses of Palestinian peasants and workers always outweighed their
    opposition to British colonialism and Zionism.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref11"
          href="#_edn11"
          name="_ednref11"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >11</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    In other words, the Palestinian elite was more interested in maintaining its
    wealth and its ties with Arab regimes than it was in leading a fight against
    British colonialism and Zionism.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, throughout the same period, Palestinian workers and peasants
    made enormous sacrifices in the nationalist struggle. In the cities, workers
    organised numerous strikes and street protests. In the countryside, peasants
    fought bravely despite years of British terror.
  </p>
  <p>
    The heroism of these workers and peasants was insufficient to overcome the
    conservative influence of the Palestinian elite in the nationalist struggle.
    In pre-1948 Palestine, the working class was still a tiny minority of the
    population, without much union or political organisation. The peasants, on
    the other hand, lacked the social cohesion necessary to play an effective
    political role. These weaknesses meant that the Palestinian masses were
    ill-prepared to take on the giant task of successfully challenging the
    British army and a well-funded and well-armed Zionist settler movement.
  </p>
  <h2>The Palestine Communist Party: A false start</h2>
  <p>
    Divided between rival factions in the Palestinian elite, the nationalist
    movement remained fragmented and weak. Under these circumstances, there was
    a clear need for a progressive left alternative. Unfortunately, the
    <a id="page_58"></a>Palestine Communist Party (PCP), the only socialist
    organisation in Palestine prior to 1948, suffered from serious political
    weaknesses that prevented it from challenging the leadership and control of
    the conservative Palestinian elite.
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded in 1924 with help from the Communist International (Comintern), the
    PCP aimed to unite Arab and Jewish workers in a struggle to build a
    socialist Palestine.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref12"
          href="#_edn12"
          name="_ednref12"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >12</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    However, the PCP, like other communist parties around the world, ceased to
    be a revolutionary organisation by the early 1930s, following Stalin’s
    ascendancy to power in Russia. Thus, the PCP formulated its policies based
    on the needs of Russian foreign policy in the Middle East, not on those of
    workers’ struggles against colonialism. This meant that the PCP followed
    orders from Moscow – even those that led to its isolation from the Arab
    masses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, party membership remained almost wholly
    Jewish, owing to its origin in a split from the left-Zionist Socialist
    Workers Party. The PCP did not produce its first Arabic publication until
    1929. The Buraq Rebellion that year caught the party unprepared. Party
    publications and spokespeople simultaneously initially characterised the
    rebellion as an anti-imperialist uprising and an anti-Jewish pogrom. In
    1935, it adopted a policy of “revolution in stages”, calling for its members
    in oppressed countries to unite with the “progressive bourgeoisie” in an
    anti-imperialist “people’s front”. In Palestine, this policy translated into
    an uncritical tailing of the traditional Arab leadership.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1943, the PCP split on national lines. Jewish members, accusing the party
    leadership of “ultra-nationalist” politics, reorganised the PCP as a party
    accepting the Zionist idea that the Yishuv, the Jewish community of
    Palestine, constituted a national group entitled to self-determination. The
    PCP’s decision to abandon the goal of fighting for a united, socialist
    Palestine drove most of the Arab cadre to quit the party. Later that year,
    some of these cadres, such as Bulus Farah, regrouped in the National
    Liberation League (NLL).
  </p>
  <p>
    A final blow to genuine socialist politics in Palestine came when the USSR
    decided to back the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947.
    Until then, the PCP had opposed partition, despite its softness on Zionism.
    When the Soviet Union announced its support for the formation of Israel, a
    state it hoped to turn into a Soviet ally in the region against the US and
    Britain, the PCP followed suit. Jewish PCP members
    <a id="page_59"></a>joined the Haganah to fight Arab resistance to the
    formation of the state of Israel in 1948. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union’s
    support for partition threw the NLL into disarray, with some leaders
    supporting partition and others opposing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, the NLL was too small and politically confused to play any
    significant role in preventing the catastrophic destruction of Palestinian
    Arab society that ensued.<sup

  </p>
  <h2>Rebirth of a national liberation movement</h2>
  <p>
    The 1948 Nakba set back the Palestinian nationalist movement for years. In
    the immediate aftermath of the war, the destruction of Palestinian Arab
    society and the transformation of 70 percent of the population into refugees
    living under authoritarian Arab regimes made it very difficult to organise
    resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    But by the mid-1950s, as Palestinians became embittered with the
    unwillingness of the Arab regimes to solve the refugee problem or to
    challenge Israel, the Palestinian nationalist movement started to revive. A
    group of Palestinian intellectuals and professionals who lived and studied
    in Arab countries – among them Yasser Arafat – formed the Palestinian
    liberation movement Fateh in 1958. Drawing on the experience of the Algerian
    war of independence against France, Fateh advocated “armed struggle”
    (guerrilla warfare) to liberate Palestine. Fateh grew in size and
    popularity.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the aftermath of Israel’s victory over Egypt, under president Gamal Abdel
    Nasser, and other Arab regimes in the June 1967 war, Fateh’s armed struggle
    gave millions of people across the Arab world hope in the possibility of
    fighting back. Fateh’s 1968 Battle of Karameh, where underequipped
    Palestinian guerrillas held off the Israel Defence Forces near the Jordanian
    town of Karameh, inspired thousands of Palestinians and others from all over
    the world to join its ranks.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1969, Fateh succeeded in taking over the PLO, an organisation that Arab
    governments had founded in 1964. As originally conceived, the PLO allowed
    the Arab governments – most notably, Nasser’s Egypt – to pay lip service to
    the Palestinian struggle, while keeping control over its activities. Under
    its chair, Ahmed Shukeiri, a Palestinian lawyer, the PLO was a weak and
    undynamic organisation. By 1969, Fateh’s prestige put it in a position to
    take the PLO’s reins as Nasser pushed Shukeiri aside. Fateh turned the
    <a id="page_60"></a>PLO into a mass organisation that included all the newly
    formed left-wing and revolutionary organisations.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref14"

          >14</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The Palestine National Charter, revised in 1968, showed the influence of the
    guerrillas on the Palestinian movement. The PLO continued to identify
    Palestine as the “indivisible territorial unit” within the borders of the
    pre-Israel British Mandate. Moreover, it asserted, “armed struggle is the
    only way to liberate Palestine. Thus it is the overall strategy, not merely
    a tactical phase… Commando action constitutes the nucleus of the Palestinian
    popular liberation war”. In addition, the charter stated that Palestinians
    “reject all solutions which are substitutes for the total liberation of
    Palestine”.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref15"

          >15</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    The radical language reflected the heady days of early guerrilla success.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fateh’s ideology appealed to Palestinians who wanted action, not diplomatic
    wrangling with Arab regime sponsors. But Fateh didn’t want to answer the
    question: “Whose Palestine?” Fateh regarded itself as a representative of
    all social classes in Palestinian society. It argued that any class
    differences among Palestinians must be put aside in order to wage a
    successful struggle. Fateh’s nationalist ideology ignored the
    irreconcilability of class antagonisms among Palestinians.

    The 1948 catastrophe affected wealthy and poor Palestinians in different
    ways. While a large number of wealthy Palestinians were able to transfer
    their assets to neighbouring Arab countries in the months leading up to the
    catastrophe, the vast majority of Palestinian peasants and workers ended up
    in UN refugee camps. So, while wealthy Palestinians were able to regroup and
    eventually play a central economic role in Arab countries, the majority of
    refugees lacked any social, economic, or political rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fateh’s nationalist ideology suited the interests of the Palestinian
    bourgeoisie. This group, on one hand, needed a movement such as Fateh to
    achieve the goal of building its own state. But, on the other hand, the
    Palestinian bourgeoisie needed to ensure that poor refugees would not rebel
    against its oppressive Arab allies. Fateh promised to fulfill both of those
    needs: mobilising the Palestinian refugees to fight Israel while avoiding
    confrontation with Arab governments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fateh adopted a “principle of non-intervention” in the internal affairs of
    Arab countries. The PLO under Fateh received billions in aid from Arab
    regimes, including the Gulf monarchies. In exchange, the PLO refused to take
    stands on political and social questions affecting the Palestinians and
    other populations of its Arab sponsors. In the oil-rich Gulf monarchies,
    <a id="page_61"></a>Palestinian workers toiled for fifty years to build the
    economies of these states while they were denied basic economic and human
    rights. Still, Fateh failed to support the struggles of Palestinian oil
    workers in the 1950s against the giant American oil company ARAMCO.<sup

    It also failed to challenge the policies of the Arab regimes, such as Egypt
    and Jordan, that jailed and tortured Palestinian activists, not to mention
    thousands of other Arab trade unionists and radicals. The non-intervention
    principle meant that Fateh compromised, time and again, with regimes that
    oppressed Palestinian refugees and lacked any interest in challenging either
    Israel or Western influence in the area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite its initial successes, the PLO paid for the “principle of
    non-intervention” with a number of serious political and military setbacks.
    The organisation’s crushing defeat in Jordan during the events of September
    1970 was the most prominent of these. In the late 1960s, the PLO had
    established itself as the main political and military force in Jordan,
    virtually eclipsing the hated regime of King Hussein. It had the political
    support of Palestinian refugees, who made up 70 percent of Jordan’s
    population. Time and again, however, Arafat turned down appeals from
    Palestinian activists, and even some Jordanian army officers, to depose the
    king and replace his regime with a democratic one. A democratic Jordan, many
    radicals believed, would provide a model for other Arab people to emulate.
    It could also unleash the potential of mass struggle that would be needed to
    fight a strong military regime such as Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the PLO’s hesitations proved costly. In September 1970, King Hussein
    used the crisis precipitated by Palestinian leftists’ airline hijackings as
    a pretext to launch an all-out military attack on the PLO. Arafat once again
    refused to enter into an all-out confrontation with the king’s regime. A
    confrontation with the king, from Arafat’s point of view, would have caused
    massive political instability in the region. It could have also endangered
    the PLO’s support among other Arab dictators. The PLO’s passive resistance
    allowed the king’s army to massacre hundreds of Palestinian activists while
    subjecting the refugee population to a reign of terror. Finally, Arafat
    agreed to transfer PLO institutions and militias from Jordan to Lebanon.<sup

    The PLO was never able to recover from its defeat in Jordan. If the Arab
    defeat in the 1967 War showed the impotence of the Arab regimes against
    Israel, “Black September” convinced the PLO leader Salah Khalaf that
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <a id="page_62"></a>it was only too evident that the Palestinian
      revolution could not count on any Arab state to provide a secure sanctuary
      or an operational base against Israel. In order to forge ahead toward the
      democratic, inter-sectarian society that was our ideal, we had to have our
      own state, even on a square inch of Palestine.<sup
        ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Khalaf’s statement put a radical-sounding gloss on an emerging shift in the
    PLO’s goals. In the immediate aftermath of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the US
    launched the “peace process” of negotiations between Arab states and Israel.
    The US aimed to win Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for Israel’s
    return of Arab land it occupied in 1967 and 1973. Arab regimes, yearning to
    establish closer relations with the US, pressured the PLO to abandon its
    radical goals. And PLO leaders increasingly looked to international
    diplomacy to win the “mini-state” they desired. Phil Marshall spells out the
    political impact of Fateh’s decision:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Fateh accepted, dropping its principal aim – the liberation of the whole
      of Palestine – in favour of the prospect of the mini-state, which was to
      be pressed on Israel by the US. Although the Fateh leadership had long
      debated the character of the Palestinian “entity” for which it struggled –
      the extent of its territory, whether it should co-exist with Israel, and
      whether it should give citizenship to Israeli Jews – it had never publicly
      conceded the Zionist movement’s right to control any area of
      Palestine.<sup
        ><span class="floating-ref-link"
          ><a
            id="_ednref19"

            >19</a
          ></span
        ></sup
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Indeed, in 1974, Arafat officially called for a two-state solution and
    accepted UN resolutions that partitioned Palestine. In a famous speech to
    the UN General Assembly, Arafat offered Israel a “historic compromise”,
    while waving a gun with one hand and an olive branch with the other. This
    compromise effectively amounted to recognition of the state of Israel and,
    in some ways, became a prelude to Oslo.
  </p>
  <p>
    The PLO’s charter, revised in 1974, reflected the shift away from armed
    struggle to the mini-state solution:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The PLO will struggle by every means, the foremost of which is armed
      struggle, to liberate Palestinian land and to establish the people’s
      national, independent and fighting sovereignty on every part of
      Palestinian land to be liberated. This requires the creation of further
      changes in the balance of power in favour of our people and their
      struggle.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The PLO completed its evolution to “peaceful coexistence” with Israel at its
    nineteenth Palestinian National Council (PNC) meeting, in 1988,
    <a id="page_63"></a>where Arafat issued a Palestinian “Declaration of
    Independence”. Meeting as the grassroots-led Intifada was tying down
    thousands of Israeli troops in the Occupied Territories, the PNC took the
    initiative to advance its diplomatic agenda for the mini-state. In
    unambiguous language, Arafat and the PNC laid out a number of historic
    concessions to Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The PNC recognised Israel. It endorsed the 1947 UN resolution that
    partitioned Palestine. It proposed that the independent Palestinian state be
    located in the West Bank and Gaza – only 23 percent of pre-1947 Palestine.
    It renounced “terrorism” (i.e., the armed struggle) and endorsed diplomacy
    as the means to achieve the mini-state. These 1988 Palestinian concessions
    paved the road to Oslo.<sup

  <h2>The Palestinian left: An alternative to Fateh?</h2>
  <p>
    In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new Palestinian left could have
    challenged Fateh’s leadership of the PLO. Two main organisations, the
    Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic
    Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), criticised Fateh’s “principle
    of non-intervention” and attempted, briefly, to build a left-wing current in
    the national liberation movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Radical Arab nationalist intellectuals, led by George Habash, founded the
    PFLP immediately after the June 1967 war. The inability of self-proclaimed
    “socialist” Arab regimes, such as Nasser’s Egypt, to live up to their
    promises of fighting Israel and US imperialism, pushed these activists to
    search for more radical means to liberate Palestine. Inspired by the
    successes of the Cuban Revolution and other anti-imperialist struggles in
    Algeria and Vietnam, and influenced by a combination of Maoist and Stalinist
    ideas, the PFLP declared itself to be a “Marxist-Leninist” organisation. It
    viewed the Palestinian cause as one part of a worldwide struggle against
    imperialism. It believed that the plight of the Palestinians was closely
    connected to the oppression of the Arab masses by Arab dictatorships and
    imperialism. Therefore, it argued that the liberation of the Palestinian
    people was tied into the struggle for a socialist society in the entire
    Middle East.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref21"
          href="#_edn21"

          class="reference-body-link"
          >21</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The PFLP rejected the notion that any of the nationalist Arab regimes was
    actually “socialist”. These “petty bourgeois”<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref22"
          href="#_edn22"
          name="_ednref22"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >22</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    regimes, the PFLP argued, were unable and unwilling to challenge Israel or
    US imperialism <a id="page_64"></a>because of their dependence on the
    international capitalist economy. A deep class antagonism between workers
    and peasants, on one hand, and the Arab bourgeoisie, on the other,
    characterised the Arab regimes. Thus, the PFLP argued, the Arab regimes
    could survive only through support from imperialist powers and suppression
    of the Arab masses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the PFLP rejected Fateh’s “principle of non-intervention” in
    the affairs of Arab regimes. In contrast to Fateh’s dependence on the Arab
    regimes, the PFLP believed that the victory of the Palestinian struggle was
    contingent on the success of the Arab masses in defeating those regimes.
    That’s why it coined the famous slogan: “The road to Jerusalem begins in
    Cairo, Damascus, and Amman”. This slogan reflected its own commitment to a
    broader vision of the needs of the struggle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, the PFLP made some attempt to orient itself on the struggles of
    Palestinian and other Arab workers and peasants. In Jordan, at the height of
    PLO influence in the late 1960s, the PFLP attempted to organise both
    Palestinian and Jordanian agricultural workers and intervened in various
    industrial struggles. It also organised its own popular militias, attracting
    many Palestinian, Jordanian, and other Arab activists. During the events of
    Black September in 1970, these militias fought bravely, yet unsuccessfully,
    to stop King Hussein’s assault on the PLO.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1970, the PFLP was forced, along with the other PLO factions, to leave
    Jordan for Lebanon. During the 1970s and 1980s, it tried to maintain its
    commitment to the liberation of Palestine. During the Lebanese civil war,
    for example, the PFLP fought on the side of other Lebanese leftist and
    Islamic militias against the Israel-backed, pro-fascist Maronite militias.
    Its members helped to defend Palestinians and the PLO against the Israeli
    onslaught in the 1982 Lebanon war. And its cadres, along with other forces,
    played on-the-ground leadership roles in the early stages of the 1987–93
    Intifada in the Occupied Territories.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"

          id="_ednref23"

          >23</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The PFLP led a “Rejectionist Front” of Palestinian organisations against the
    PLO’s adoption of the “mini-state” formula in 1974. Despite its radical
    critique of PLO strategy, the PFLP suffered from a series of major
    contradictions and weaknesses. These problems prevented it from building a
    revolutionary alternative to Fateh.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, while it rejected, correctly, the notion that some Arab regimes were
    socialist, the PFLP made a false distinction between reactionary regimes
    that accommodated to imperialism and progressive nationalist ones
    <a id="page_65"></a>that were forced to fight against it. Thus, based on
    this distinction, the PFLP allied itself with a number of repressive Arab
    governments, such as the Ba’athist regime in Iraq and the Assad regime in
    Syria. Ultimately, these alliances cost the PFLP its political independence
    and reduced it to a tool in the hands of some Arab rulers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, the PFLP, similar to the rest of the Stalinist left in the Arab
    world, allied itself with what it considered to be “real” socialist
    societies, the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc. This meant that,
    throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the PFLP was regularly manipulated by the
    Soviet Union and forced to adapt to the Cold War needs of Soviet foreign
    policy in the area. Its vision of Marxism-Leninism was expressed in the
    Cuban Revolution, where a small group of guerrillas defeated a US-backed
    dictator and, a few years later, declared Cuba a socialist society. Cuban
    workers and peasants did not take part in making the revolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the PFLP’s chief tactical contribution to the growing Palestinian
    movement in 1968–72 was its use of airline hijackings to publicise the
    Palestinian cause.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref24"
          href="#_edn24"
          name="_ednref24"
          class="reference-body-link"
          >24</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    As a result, it substituted the actions of its small, committed membership
    for the mass struggle of the Arab workers and peasants it aimed to relate
    to. As the Palestinians faced one of the world’s chief military powers, it
    became apparent that guerrilla tactics alone could not win. And although
    millions of people across the Arab world supported the Palestinians’ armed
    struggle, the nature of that struggle prevented them from taking part.
    Therefore, the reliance on this tactic left the PFLP (and PLO) militias
    relatively small in size and unable to pose a serious military threat to
    Israel. Also, more critically, it isolated the PFLP from the mass struggles
    that took place against the Arab regimes and US imperialism in the late
    1960s and early 1970s – especially the workers’ and students’ movement in
    Egypt (1968–72).<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref25"

          >25</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the PFLP’s political weaknesses left it ill-equipped to
    respond to changing circumstances in the Middle East and returned to its
    role as internal critic of Fateh in the PLO. By the mid-1980s, as the PFLP
    failed to have much impact on Fateh’s search for the mini-state solution, it
    joined Fateh and other PLO factions in support of the 1983 Arab summit
    proposal for a mini-state in Gaza and the West Bank. Effectively, the PFLP
    adopted Fateh’s two-state solution.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref26"

          >26</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The DFLP began in 1969 as a left-wing split from the PFLP. While it shared
    the PFLP’s politics overall, the DFLP rejected the distinction
    <a id="page_66"></a>between reactionary and nationalist Arab regimes. This
    distinction, the DFLP argued, simply allowed the PFLP to rely on
    petty-bourgeois regimes that were inconsistent in their fight against
    imperialism. Instead, the DFLP argued correctly that the Arab working
    classes are the only social force capable of defeating Israel and US
    imperialism. The DFLP was the first of the Palestinian resistance groups to
    work with allies in the Israeli left. It pioneered the idea that
    Palestinians should fight for a “secular, democratic state” in Palestine,
    where Arabs and Jews would have equal rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, following the defeat of the PLO in Black September, the DFLP
    shifted sharply to the right. Using the mechanical, Stalinist theory of
    stages, in which “democratic” demands (for example, national liberation)
    were to be prioritised and achieved before the struggle for socialism could
    begin, the DFLP abandoned its previous radical positions. The DFLP now
    argued that the revolutionary left should put the goal of socialism or the
    total liberation of Palestine on hold. Instead, the left must strive, in the
    short term, to build a Palestinian state “in any liberated piece of land
    Israel could be forced to give up”. In 1974, DFLP leader Nayef Hawatmeh
    called for the formation of a Palestinian “national authority” in Gaza and
    the West Bank, believing that the Palestinian mini-state could be achieved
    through the peace process. This meant that, four long years before Arafat
    himself dared to utter it, the Palestinian left was actually ready to
    recognise the state of Israel and accept the two-state solution. Since the
    early 1970s, the DFLP has, even more than the PFLP, simply tailed Fateh’s
    compromises and zigzags.<sup

  <h2>The Islamic opposition</h2>
  <p>
    The failure of the PLO and its left wing over the past 30 years to provide a
    clear, effective leadership in the national struggle or to win any of the
    rights that millions of Palestinians desperately await has hurt the
    credibility of secular organisations. Moreover, the anti-democratic and
    corrupt practices of the Palestinian Authority (PA) have turned many more
    ordinary Palestinians against it. These conditions explain why, in recent
    years, a large section of Palestinian society has looked to the Islamic
    Resistance Movement (Hamas) and, to a lesser degree, the Islamic Jihad, to
    resist Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hamas’s formal opposition to the Oslo Accords and Palestinian negotiators’
    endless concessions resonated with people who recognised the futility
    <a id="page_67"></a>of negotiations. Its insistence on the liberation of the
    whole of Palestine connects with the aspirations of Palestinian refugees to
    return to their country.
  </p>
  <p>
    From 1967 until the outbreak of the First Intifada in 1987, the Muslim
    Brotherhood dominated the Islamic movement in Palestine. The Brotherhood
    attracted a considerable number of people who were alienated by the
    miserable conditions under Israeli occupation. However, the Brotherhood
    refused to play any active role in resisting Israel. Instead, it focused on
    missionary work, such as the construction of mosques, and providing various
    social and health services to needy Palestinians. The organisation’s
    non-political position increasingly frustrated many of its younger cadres.
    As a result, in the late 1970s, some of these cadres began to look to the
    more radical Egyptian Islamic Jihad.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref28"

          >28</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    This younger generation admired the political activism of the Egyptian
    organisation, known predominantly for its role in the assassination of (the
    pro-Israel) President Sadat in 1981. Eventually, these disgruntled elements
    broke with the Muslim Brotherhood to form the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
  </p>
  <p>
    Islamic Jihad rejected the non-political stance of the Brotherhood, as well
    as the PLO’s two-state solution compromise. It maintained, as the PLO and
    its left did at one point, that an armed struggle (this time by an “Islamic
    vanguard”) was still necessary to liberate the whole of Palestine.
    Therefore, throughout the 1980s, Jihad carried out military attacks on
    Israeli targets, though Israel’s overwhelming military superiority kept
    Islamic Jihad’s influence relatively limited.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a
          id="_ednref29"

          >29</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The outbreak of the first Palestinian Intifada in 1987 fundamentally changed
    the fortunes of the Islamic opposition. Under the pressure of the first
    Intifada, the Muslim Brotherhood realised that it either had to drop its
    non-political approach or risk losing all credibility among Palestinians.
    Therefore, in 1988, the Brotherhood formed a political wing, Hamas, to
    organise resistance to Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hamas’s own original charter reflected the Palestinians’ disappointment with
    the failure of the PLO’s diplomatic efforts and manoeuvres to secure any of
    their lost rights. Sections of Hamas’s charter express this sentiment:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad (Holy
      Struggle). The initiatives, proposals and International Conferences are
      but a waste of time, an exercise in futility. The Palestinian people are
      too noble to have their future, their right and their destiny submitted to
      a vain game.<sup

    <a id="page_68"></a>It rejected Arafat’s decision to recognise the state of
    Israel at the 1988 session of the PNC in Algeria. And, while the PLO was
    busy preparing to use the Intifada as a bargaining chip to force Israel to
    the negotiating table, Hamas began to gain more popular support by playing a
    leading role in street protests and confrontations with the Israeli army.
  </p>
  <p>
    As millions of Palestinians grew impatient with the continued arrogance of
    Israel and Arafat’s endless compromises, Hamas gained more popular support.
    Its refusal to recognise the Oslo Accords and willingness of its members to
    sacrifice themselves in military attacks on Israeli targets earned them the
    respect of people who face Israeli bombardment on a daily basis.<sup

    By early 2002, Palestinian opinion polls showed support for Islamist groups
    drawing even with, or even exceeding, support for Arafat’s secular Fateh
    movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    The increased support for Hamas currents does not mean that they offer any
    solution for Palestinians. Hamas believes in the sanctity of private
    property and supports a market-based economy. This belief leads it to have a
    contradictory position toward US imperialism. On one hand, it finds itself
    pitted against the US due to US support for Israel. On the other, Hamas
    tends to adopt the market ideas pushed by the US – and its financial arms in
    the area, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank – that are
    responsible for the misery of millions of Arab workers and peasants.
    Furthermore, due to its conservative ideology, Hamas is unable to challenge
    the Arab regimes that ally themselves with the US, especially the right-wing
    monarchies in the Gulf, such as Saudi Arabia. In this way, Hamas agrees with
    Fateh’s costly principle of non-interference in the affairs of Arab
    countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hamas’s leadership is drawn primarily from middle-class elements. Therefore,
    it tends to sympathise with the goals of the Palestinian bourgeoisie. Like
    Fateh, Hamas also believes in the necessity of an alliance between all
    classes in Palestinian society. In practice, this means that the interests
    of Palestinian refugees and workers must be subordinated to those of Arafat
    and the bourgeoisie. On more than one occasion, Hamas leadership has
    indicated its readiness to accept Oslo and live with the state of Israel. As
    early as 1993, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the political leader of Hamas, indicated
    that the movement could accept a two-state solution: “It is perceivable to
    declare a cease-fire with Israel for 10, perhaps 20 years if a Palestinian
    state is established”.<sup

    Despite Hamas’s critique of the PLO’s insistence on a strategy of
    compromise, it continues to defer to the PLO (and Arafat) as the legitimate
    <a id="page_69"></a>leader of the Palestinian nationalist movement. Hamas
    regards itself simply as one component of that movement:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The PLO is among the closest to the Hamas, for it constitutes a father, a
      brother, a relative, a friend. Can a Muslim turn away from his father, his
      brother, his relative or his friend? Our homeland is one, our calamity is

    While the PA imprisoned and tortured its members, Hamas insisted on the need
    “to maintain open dialogue with Arafat and cooperation with the PA in all
    areas of self-autonomy”. This conciliatory approach toward the PA has

  <h2>Oslo and the crisis of perspectives</h2>
  <p>
    Three decades ago, millions around the world regarded the PLO as one of the
    main national liberation movements in the world, on par with the Vietnamese
    National Liberation Front and the African National Congress of South Africa.
    Tragically, today the PLO is a shadow of its former self. It has all but
    given up on its initial goals of liberating Palestine and replacing Israel
    with a secular, democratic state.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Oslo “peace process” trapped the main forces of the Palestinian national
    liberation movement in a cul-de-sac. The PLO, reconstituted as the
    Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza after the 1993 Oslo Accords,
    unashamedly cooperates with both Israel’s internal security service
    (Shinbet) and the CIA to curb Palestinian militants. It claims that such
    cooperation is needed to persuade Washington to support a Palestinian state.
    It uses its massive security forces (more than fifty thousand strong) to
    jail, torture, and even murder those Palestinians who oppose Oslo.<sup
      ><span class="floating-ref-link"

          >35</a
        ></span
      ></sup
    >
    The PLO has ceased to be a force in the struggle against imperialism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Incredibly, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US in September
    2001, the PLO declared itself a “partner of the US in its war against
    terrorism”. Not only did the PLO support the bombing of Afghanistan, one of
    the poorest countries on earth, but its security forces shot and killed
    Palestinians who protested against the war.
  </p>
  <p>
    Large numbers of Palestinians view Arafat as safeguarding Israel’s security
    – not conducting a struggle for liberation. Many are angry, since years of
    negotiations have failed to end the occupation, stop the
    <a id="page_70"></a>expansion of Israeli settlements, or secure the
    refugees’ right of return. They are also angry because poverty and
    unemployment levels for ordinary people have worsened, while Arafat and his
    cronies have made fortunes through corruption and monopolies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people view the PLO’s surrender to Israel and the US, as well as its
    internal brutality, as a case of “selling out”. This view, however,
    overlooks the real reason behind the PLO’s capitulation to the US and
    Israel: the class interests that have always informed the organisation’s
    policies. The PLO claimed that it represented the interests of all
    Palestinians. In reality, it has always served the interests of the
    Palestinian bourgeoisie – especially this class’s desire to form its own
    mini-state through negotiations and compromise with the US and Israel. It
    has never wanted to rely on popular struggles of Palestinian or Arab masses,
    which could endanger the stability of both it and its Arab allies.
  </p>
  <p>
    This fear of mass rebellion from below, which is characteristic of all
    ruling classes, explains why the PLO has always had a contradictory attitude
    toward mass struggles. The PLO needs some form of struggle to pressure
    Israel into making concessions, but it constantly has to try (sometimes
    unsuccessfully) to keep any such struggles, especially the Intifadas, under
    its own control. It also explains why the PLO always supports its Arab
    allies when they are faced with a threat from their own working classes. In
    1970, for example, the PLO chose to leave Jordan rather than challenge and
    destabilise the authoritarian regime of King Hussein. In 1988 and 1989, it
    chose to support the Algerian and Jordanian governments against two popular
    uprisings that the first Intifada inspired.<sup

    In response to the Oslo Accords in 1993, the established Palestinian left
    harshly criticised Arafat for signing a treaty that only benefited Israel
    and failed to guarantee any of the Palestinians’ fundamental rights. The two
    organisations joined with eight other radical Palestinian organisations to
    boycott the PA. In 1996, the PFLP formally withdrew from the PLO. But after
    1994, the PA increasingly shaped Palestinian politics. PFLP and DFLP leaders
    opposed participation in the 1996 legislative council elections. This
    provoked an organisational split in the DFLP, spawning another party (FIDA)
    that ran candidates and took a position in the PA. Supporters of the PFLP in
    the electorate largely ignored the leadership’s calls for boycotts, and many
    party members ran as independents without official PFLP backing.<sup

  <p>
    <a id="page_71"></a>As Arafat prepared to enter into “final status”
    negotiations with Israel when the Oslo Accords’ transition period ran out in
    1999, the DFLP and PFLP entered into negotiations with Arafat to prepare a
    united national stance. Most Palestinian political observers interpreted
    these moves as these groups’ admission that they had failed to develop a
    coherent opposition to the Oslo process. At the time, the late PFLP leader
    Abu Ali Mustafa admitted that the opposition “has failed to transform its
    political discourse into practical, material action”.<sup

    In 1999, both groups endorsed Arafat’s plan to reach a “final status”
    agreement with Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The failure of the secular left to build a left opposition to Fateh and the
    Palestinian Authority stems from their failure to apply their initial
    insights on the reactionary nature of the Arab ruling classes to the
    Palestinian bourgeoisie itself. As the Jerusalem-based socialist magazine
    <em>Challenge</em> explained:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      At first, when the Oslo Accords were signed, the leftist parties began a
      campaign against them, calling on the Palestinians to boycott the
      Palestine Authority (PA) which had joined the colonialist system. The aim
      was to bring the bourgeoisie back into the national camp. When this
      failed, the organised Left decided to acknowledge Oslo as a fait accompli;
      it began calling for national unity, this time on the basis of simply
      “overlooking” Oslo. Instead of doing its utmost to isolate the bourgeoisie
      from the masses, the Palestinian Left put all its efforts into finding a
      national common denominator with the bourgeoisie. The latter, of course,
      never committed itself to this common denominator. The bourgeois simply
      used the concept to cover up their surrender so as to keep their grip on
      the masses. The illusion of national unity among all classes served
      bourgeois interests and prevented the Left from fulfilling its strategic
      task: to create a political alternative.<sup

    In fact, their influence has fallen so far that journalist Graham Usher, a
    longtime observer of Palestinian politics, declared them politically
    impotent:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The future alliance of the national movement is between mainstream
      nationalists, Fateh, and the Islamicists. The leftists, the Communists,
      the Democratic Front (DF), and the Popular Front (PF) are nowhere. They
      are history. They have no road. They follow Fateh and Hamas. The Popular
      Front resumed armed actions in the last two months [in summer 2001 –
      <em>Ed</em>.] purely and simply because they are copying Fateh, Hamas,
      <a id="page_72"></a>and Islamic Jihad. Same with the Democratic Front. So
      the secular left…no longer makes the decisions. It’s Hamas and Fateh.

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Since Oslo, the PLO has felt itself under pressure from above and below.
    From above, it is under pressure from the US and Israel to continue with
    concessions and crackdowns on militants. From below, mass anger at endless
    and fruitless concessions, which exploded in the form of the al-Aqsa
    Intifada, limits Arafat’s ability to make certain concessions. Arafat was
    not totally off the mark when he reportedly told President Bill Clinton that
    he feared he would be assassinated if he were to make any more concessions
    to Israel during the 2000 Camp David negotiations.
  </p>
  <h2>The socialist alternative</h2>
  <p>
    Both the First Intifada and the al-Aqsa Intifada have shown that, despite
    its massive military might and US support, Israel cannot silence the
    Palestinian question. However, they have also shown that the struggle of the
    Palestinians alone cannot defeat Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    In its initial stages, the al-Aqsa Intifada combined mobilisation of the
    Palestinian population with military attacks on Israeli soldiers and
    settlers. Because the Arafat regime saw the Intifada as a bargaining chip to
    restart negotiations with Israel, it wound up the popular aspects of the
    uprising and increasingly turned the conflict into sporadic military
    confrontations. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the
    US, the Sharon government stepped up its military assault on the
    Palestinians. Sharon declared his intention to use the “war on terrorism” to
    crush all resistance and to impose an apartheid system on Palestinians. This
    raised the stakes in the liberation struggle. Only a strategy that involves
    the mass of Palestinians – not one that vacillates between isolated
    guerrilla actions and negotiations that simply reinforce Israeli domination
    over Palestine – can defend the liberation movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the near term, a strategy of a mass Intifada – combining military tactics
    with mass actions of Palestinian “civil society” (such as trade unions and
    popular committees) – can move the struggle in a direction more favourable
    to the Palestinians. This kind of strategy has the potential to raise the
    costs of the occupation and to break Israeli morale. It can give confidence
    to those on the other side of the Green Line – military resisters,
    <a id="page_73"></a>Israeli supporters of Palestinian rights, and
    Palestinians living in Israel – to demonstrate their solidarity. This kind
    of strategy would also shift the balance in Palestinian society toward
    ordinary Palestinians and democracy and away from the Arafat cronies and
    corrupt PA officials who sought to rule an Oslo-imposed Bantustan in
    collaboration with Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if the Palestinians drove Israel out of the territories occupied in
    1967, this achievement would not amount to the liberation of Palestine. The
    Zionist state would still exist, and Palestinians would not have won their
    right to return to their historic homeland. Palestinian oppression is firmly
    built into the US-supported state system in the Middle East. Therefore,
    Palestinian liberation depends on ending that state system and forming a
    democratic, secular state in all of historic Palestine where Jews and Arabs
    can live as equals. The only force capable of achieving that task is the
    working class of the region. This point in no way diminishes the centrality
    of Palestinian struggle and sacrifice. It only stresses that for
    Palestinians to finally liberate themselves, Arab workers have to shake off
    their chains, too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Millions of ordinary Arab people live in poverty under oppressive
    governments that the US supports. In addition, they see how US power
    enforces genocidal sanctions on Iraq that have killed hundreds of thousands
    of Iraqis and left its economy in a shambles. And they see how US power
    backs up Israel’s denial of basic human rights to millions of Palestinians.
    This combination of growing class inequality in the region and the miserable
    conditions of both the Iraqi and Palestinian peoples is pushing many over
    the edge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deepening class anger and growing support for Iraqis and Palestinians
    underpinned the outbreak of mass demonstrations across Egypt immediately
    after the al-Aqsa Intifada began and during Israel’s spring 2002 onslaught
    on the Occupied Territories. Tens of thousands of workers, lawyers, and
    students (from the college to the elementary level) took to the streets of
    major cities (and even villages) to show their solidarity with the Intifada.
    The demonstrations demanded that the Mubarak government cut diplomatic
    relations with Israel. These solidarity demonstrations quickly turned into
    protests against the Mubarak government itself. The demonstrators very
    quickly raised slogans and chants denouncing widespread corruption, lack of
    political freedoms, and austerity measures imposed by the government and the
    IMF. The neoliberal reforms are fuelling a rising militancy among workers
    that has made the Egyptian government very nervous.<sup

  </p>
  <p>
    <a id="page_74"></a>In Jordan, for many years, Palestinian refugees and the
    majority of ordinary Jordanians have suffered due to harsh economic
    conditions caused by the sanctions against Jordan’s main trade partner,
    Iraq, as well as vicious austerity programs imposed by a corrupt monarchy.
    As in Egypt, during the 2002 Israeli invasion, thousands of people took to
    the streets to support it. Since then, the Jordanian government, on more
    than one occasion, had to call the army to control pro-Palestinian
    demonstrators.
  </p>
  <p>
    Demonstrations have also taken place in Morocco, Syria and even in the Gulf
    countries of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, where protests of this type were far
    less common. The evolution of solidarity protests with the Intifada into
    anti-government protests highlighted, once again, the close connection
    between the plight of the Palestinians and struggle of the Arab working
    classes for democracy. It showed the radicalising impact that the
    Palestinian struggle has always had on Arab workers. Time and again, the
    Palestinian national liberation struggle has inspired both Arab workers and
    students to resist their own repressive governments, as well as US
    domination in the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
    Millions of Arabs who were demoralised by Israel’s 1967 victory over the
    Arab regimes drew hope from the armed resistance of the PLO. The PLO’s
    resistance proved that it was still possible to fight both Israel and US
    imperialism. The PLO’s initial military successes against Israel (1968–70),
    in turn, gave confidence to ordinary Arabs to resist their own bankrupt and
    humiliated regimes. Mass movements of workers and students in Egypt
    (1968–72) and Jordan (1970) challenged these regimes. Reciprocally,
    thousands of youths and revolutionaries from around the Middle East flocked
    to join the PLO’s militias.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spontaneous struggles of Arab workers or students will not be enough to
    defeat Israel and US imperialism. A socialist alternative rooted in the
    day-to-day struggles of Arab workers against the oppression and the
    corruption of their own regimes must be built. It must reject the PLO’s (and
    the Arab regimes’) collaboration with Israel and the United States. And it
    must fight for an Arab world run democratically by the workers who create
    all its oil wealth. The nationalist tradition, embodied most in the
    mainstream PLO, ran into the cul-de-sac of Oslo. This offered an opening to
    the Islamists, whose militancy covers for a reactionary social agenda.
  </p>
  <p>
    Real hope for the future in Palestine lies in the building of a genuine
    socialist alternative to these politics. Building such an alternative will
    not be <a id="page_75"></a>an easy task in Palestine or in the rest of the
    Arab world, given the level of repression by the PA and other Arab
    governments. Moreover, a new generation of socialists has to overcome the
    legacy of Stalinism and its harmful impact on the left. This will require
    the rediscovery of the real Marxist tradition, which has always looked to
    struggles of the working class – and not to Stalinist Russia or some
    authoritarian Arab regime that calls itself “socialist” or “progressive” –
    as the way to change society. It will be critical for us to learn from the
    mistakes of the old Stalinist organisations and connect these lessons to the
    struggles of today.<a id="page_76"></a>

      The Russian Bolshevik Party formed the Comintern in 1919 to organise mass
      communist parties around the world. A number of Arab socialists,
      especially from Egypt and Palestine, were fascinated by the example of the
      Russian Revolution and its recognition of the right of self-determination
      for oppressed nationalities in the tsarist Russian empire. This led to the
      formation of small communist parties in a number of Arab countries,
      including Palestine.

      Marshall, Intifada, 99–101. In the mid-1950s, Palestinian oil workers led
      a series of militant strikes against oil companies in Saudi Arabia and the
      other Gulf states. In 1956, Palestinian workers organised protests against
      the invasion of Suez. This prompted the Gulf countries to ban strikes in
      the oil fields.

      Graham Usher, unpublished interview with Anthony Arnove, Ahmed Shawki and
      Nigel Harris, Jerusalem, July 2001. A theoretical slide has accompanied
      the DFLP and PFLP loss of political initiative. Once considering
      themselves a vanguard in the region against US imperialism, the DFLP’s
      former general secretary, Nayef Hawatmeh, recently wrote: “The Palestinian
      national liberation movement must set itself the goal of communication and
      reaching a common understanding with the US. This could help convince the
      US to pressure Israel to respect all previous UN resolutions and
      international law”. And PFLP founder George Habash recently declared: “It
      is no longer necessary to fight against US imperialism or defeat it in
      order to defeat Israel” (CSS, 101–4).
