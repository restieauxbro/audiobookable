  <p><b>Israel, the US, and imperialism</b></p>
  <p>
    In July 1956, Egyptian president, Colonel Abdul Nasser, announced the
    nationalisation of the Suez Canal. Britain and France, the old colonial
    powers, had together with Israel, conspired to invade Egypt, seize control
    of the canal and overthrow Nasser. On 29 October Israeli forces attacked,
    and British and French troops followed on 5 November. Within two days it was
    over, ending in humiliation for Britain and France. President Eisenhower,
    who had warned against invasion, cut off finance to Britain from the
    International Monetary Fund and threatened sanctions, fuelling a massive run
    on sterling. Britain, facing bankruptcy and devaluation of the pound,
    accepted a UN ceasefire and withdrawal.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outcome of the 1956 Suez Crisis reflected the new imperialist order
    after 1945. The US and the Soviet Union now confronted each other as global
    nuclear superpowers; the middle east was a growing site of superpower
    rivalry. As the Soviet Union accelerated arms supplies to Egypt, Syria and
    Iraq, the US looked to counter Soviet influence. After Suez, Israel
    recognised the US as the key imperialist power and increasingly sought an
    alliance. Whilst the US had opposed the 1956 invasion, the tension between
    the US and Israel soon loosened. By 1962, President Kennedy declared a
    special relationship with Israel comparable to that with Britain.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first key watershed came with the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The war left
    Israel the most formidable military power in the region; President Nixon
    told Henry Kissinger that Israel was the only effective opponent to Soviet
    expansion in the Middle East and the US now overtook France as Israel’s main
    source of arms.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the second turning point came with the Arab-Israeli war of 1973;
    here the outcome was more ambiguous. The Arab armies took Israel and its
    imperialist patron by surprise. Whilst Israel emerged as the victor, the
    initial defeats punctured assumptions of Israeli invulnerability.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the 1973 war, the cornerstone of US policy was to establish Israel’s
    permanent military and technological superiority, known as “Qualitative
    Military Edge”. Up to 1973, US foreign military sales to any one recipient
    were capped at $250 million per year. In 1974, US military aid to Israel
    rocketed to $2.2 billion, setting an annual benchmark since. A senior state
    department official defined Qualitative Military Edge as the guarantee of
    Israel’s ability to “counter and defeat credible military threats from any
    individual state, coalition of states, or non-state actor, while sustaining
    minimal damages or casualties… Each and every security assistance request
    from the Israeli Government is evaluated in light of our policy to uphold
    Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge.” This policy was written into US law by
    the Obama administration.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, the US has sought to bring the Arab regimes into its camp.
    After the defeat of 1973, Egypt began negotiations with Israel and in 1979,
    President Sadat signed the Egypt-Israel peace treaty. Egypt became the
    second biggest recipient of US military aid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nonetheless, US imperialism faces a fundamental quandary: the
    vulnerabilities of the Arab regimes. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the
    Palestinian struggle combined with popular resentment, posing a threat to
    Arab rulers, and acted as a catalyst for anti-imperialist sentiment across
    the region.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1970, civil war erupted in Jordan between Palestinians and their allies
    on one side, and the autocrat and key US ally, King Hussein, on the other.
    Syria backed the revolt seeking an advantage against a regional rival.
    However, Israel confronted Syria in the Golan and Jordan valley; King
    Hussein’s forces overwhelmed the Palestinians and forced a Syrian
    withdrawal.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the civil war in Jordan, US Aid to Israel rose five-fold from under
    $300 million between 1968-1970 to $1.5 billion in 1971-1973 – even
    <i>before</i> the 1973 October war. The same pattern was repeated after the
    Iranian revolution and during the civil war in Lebanon and Israel’s invasion
    in 1982. After the Iranian revolution and the overthrow of the Shah,
    arguably the US’s most important ally on the Persian Gulf, US military aid
    to Israel sky-rocketed to its highest ever level in real terms – at over $5
    billion at 2018 dollar value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, the biggest spikes in military aid took place when the Arab regimes
    were threatened by mass revolt, and when Israel faced mass resistance from
    Palestinians. For example after the first intifada in the late 1980s, and
    the second intifada in the early 2000s. These increases were proportionally
    greater in real terms even than were the increases after the Arab-Israeli
    wars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of US military aid since
    1945, totalling $160 billion. Israel also has the world’s largest F-16 fleet
    except for the United States Air Force. In 2011, as Arab revolutions shook
    the Middle East, Andrew J. Shapiro, assistant secretary for the Middle East
    at the state department, in an
    <a
      href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/pm/rls/rm/176684.htm"
      previewlistener="true"
      >address</a
    >
    entitled “Ensuring Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge” referred to the
    storming of the Israeli embassy by anti-regime protestors in Cairo. Shapiro
    insisted the Obama administration was providing unprecedented levels of aid
    to Israel “at a time when Israel needs our support to address the
    multifaceted threats it faces.”

    There is a side point to be made here but an important one. The trajectory
    of the relationship between US imperialism and Israel shows that to place
    emphasis on a “Zionist Lobby” manipulating US foreign policy is misplaced
    and misleading. This gets things the wrong way round. The US is the most
    powerful imperialist power in history. It needs no persuading that Israel is
    an indispensable strategic asset in defence of US imperialist interests in
    the middle east.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, before 1973, what is now the largest pro-Israel lobby, the American
    Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, was a marginal shoe-string operation
    that sometimes was not able to pay its own staff. It only rose to
    significance in the 1980s, long <em>after</em> massive escalation in US
    military aid to Israel and the US policy of establishing Israel’s
    “Qualitative Military Edge”.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Israel – A Militarised Economy</strong></p>
  <p>
    What does Israel’s imperialist role mean for Israel itself? Both Israel’s
    society and economy is highly militarised. The massive acceleration of US
    military and economic aid to Israel since the 1970s is central to the
    political economy of the Zionist project. Military spending laid the basis
    for a boom in high-tech and research-intensive manufacturing that fuelled
    the Israeli economy.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1965, high-tech industries accounted for 37% of industrial production; by
    2006, the figure was 70%. As a percentage, computer and communications rose
    from 36% of service exports in 1995 to 78% in 2019. The huge investment by
    the US feeds back into the high-tech sector and Israel’s industrial base.
  </p>
  <p>
    Israel has a dual foundation: maintaining the apartheid system over
    Palestinians on one hand and acting as regional enforcer of US imperialist
    interests on the other. The apartheid state is more than a foul system of
    dispossession and domination. It reflects a particular form of capitalist
    development of imperialism in the middle east.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >A Colonial Settler State – Fortress of Imperialist Interests</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The understanding of how the settler-colonial garrison is embedded into the
    imperialist order helps explain why US support for Israel is unconditional.
    Even faced with far-right pogromists in power, there are no red lines in US
    support for Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Addressing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Summit in
    June, Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken
    <a
      href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-2023-american-israel-public-affairs-committee-policy-summit/"

      >declared</a
    >
    that the US-Israel commitment to Israel’s ‘security’ was “non-negotiable”
    and “ironclad”. He continued to detail the $3.3 billion per annum in foreign
    military financing; an additional $500 million funding for missile defense,
    tens of millions for counter-drone and anti-tunneling technologies and an
    additional $1 billion funding for Israel’s Iron Dome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course true the US also relies on Arab regimes. However, there is a
    fundamental feature that distinguishes Israel from the Arab rulers. These
    regimes can be brought down by revolt from below. Pillars of US imperialism
    such as the Shah of Iran in 1979, Mubarak in Egypt in 2011 have been deposed
    through revolt from below, a threat that all Arab rulers of the region fear.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this, Israel has a distinguishing feature. There is no settler-colonial
    state in history that has dissolved itself. It is this that makes Israel a
    uniquely vital fortress of imperialist interests.
  </p>
  <p><strong>After the Cold War: 1991 – 2023</strong></p>
  <p>
    However, the imperialist order is not static; imperialism is a system driven
    by competing states. That process is dynamic, generating tensions and
    conflict as the relative position of rival powers shifts.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the Cold War, the US emerged as the world’s sole military
    superpower. However, the US has suffered a continuing relative decline in
    its dominance over world trade and production. The US has therefore sought
    to re-assert hegemony through the exercise of military might – in the Balkan
    Wars, Somalia, the first Gulf War of 1991, in the 1990s bombing campaigns
    and sanctions against Iraq. The 1990s closed with the Kosovan war, the NATO
    campaign against Serbia, and the onset of NATO’s massive expansion eastward.
  </p>
  <p>
    This vision of US global dominance was expressed most explicitly in the
    neo-con “project of the New American Century” that informed the Bush
    administration. This vision met its nemesis in the Middle East amidst the
    disastrous defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan. The key beneficiary of the Iraq
    War was the United States’ historic foe – Iran. This led to intensified
    confrontation between Iran, Saudi and other Gulf states… and of course,
    Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, Russia emerged from the collapse of the 1990s on a tide of
    oil and gas revenues, and now Russia’s intervention in support of the Syrian
    regime further highlighted US weakness.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Palestine and the Arab Spring</strong></p>
  <p>
    Here we need to turn to the question of Palestinian resistance and the Arab
    revolution. The first Intifada at the end of the 1980s led to the Oslo
    Accords of the early 90s. The Accords held out a false promise of a future
    Palestinian state in an attempt to quell Palestinian resistance while
    harnessing the PLO leadership to collaboration. By 2000 Oslo was buried in a
    massive tide of settlement expansion and ethnic cleansing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fraud of&nbsp; the Oslo Accords sparked the second intifada of the
    2000s, and the election victory of Hamas in 2006, followed by the blockade
    and repeated assaults by Israel on Gaza. This brings us towards today. In
    May 2021 the “unity intifada” erupted across historic Palestine and new
    forces of resistance emerged, particularly amongst Palestinian youth and
    above all amongst Palestinians with Israeli citizenship within “1948
    Israel”.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Arab revolutions of 2011 sent shock waves through the middle east and
    centres of imperialist power. The Palestinian struggle was invoked
    repeatedly in the mass protests. Starting on Nakba Day in May, thousands of
    protestors attempted to approach or breach the Israeli border from Lebanon,
    Syria, Egypt, and Jordan.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Egypt thousands planned to drive to the border in convoys of buses from
    across the country. The military ordered bus companies to cancel their
    transport and stopped any who approached the border. At the Syrian border,
    Syrian police were overwhelmed; four protestors were killed and dozens
    injured when Israeli soldiers opened fire. In September 2011, a mass protest
    laid siege to the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. Thousands broke down the
    security wall, occupied and ransacked the embassy for two days. Embassy
    security staff were rescued by Egyptian commandos; the ambassador and 85
    diplomats fled to Tel Aviv.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2020, the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco signed the Abraham Accords with
    Israel, Saudi and other Gulf states moving towards closer collaboration. As
    the
    <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/15/world/middleeast/israel-uae-netanyahu-arabs.html"
      previewlistener="true"
      ><em>New York Times</em></a
    >
    put it: “The Arab Spring uprisings had shown Gulf monarchs that popular
    anger over repression and corruption were bigger threats to their rule than
    any blowback over their failure to maintain solidarity with the
    Palestinians”. In addition, the Gulf rulers shared economic interests with
    Israel – one influential Gulf think tank argued that normalisation of
    relations with Israel would bring an arc of prosperity across the region.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Shifts in Imperialist Power </strong></p>
  <p>
    However, the tectonic plates of imperialist power are shifting. China’s
    brokering of the Saudi-Iranian deal is a hugely important indication. China
    needs stability in the Gulf from where it gets over 40% of its crude oil. It
    has important investments in the Saudi energy sector and interest in a
    potential energy pipeline transit corridor through Iran that would provide
    an alternative trade route to the Suez Canal and the South China Sea.
  </p>
  <p>
    For its part, Saudi Arabia is investing billions of dollars to attract
    foreign investment. It no longer sees itself simply as a security vassal of
    the United States but a regional power, even while it maintains a strategic
    alliance with the US. As one Saudi official put it, “The United States fails
    to understand that we cannot be allies at the expenses of our interests”.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
  <p>
    The state of Israel is not an anachronism or a left-over from the colonial
    period. Israeli apartheid has been <em>reproduced by</em> the dynamics of
    imperialism in the Middle East; it is cemented to US imperialism. Change
    will not come from the Arab ruling classes, nor from forces within Israeli
    settler society. To bring the Zionist state to an end and forge a free
    Palestine of equality for all its citizens will require a challenge to
    imperialism from the Arab masses themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this, Palestinians are not simply the passive beneficiary of struggles in
    the wider region, they act as a potential detonator of revolt. Palestinian
    resistance ebbs and flows but is permanently inscribed in the struggle
    against settler colonialism and imperialism in the Middle East. Whenever the
    working class and oppressed in the Middle East challenge their own regimes,
    they confront the imperialist order and in doing so they confront the
    Zionist state. The process that began with the Arab revolutions of 2011 is
    not over.
  </p>
  <p>
    The struggle for a free Palestine is therefore an indissoluble part of the
    struggle against imperialism in the Middle East and the anti-imperialist
    struggle here at home.
