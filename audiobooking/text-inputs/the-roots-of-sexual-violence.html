    Twenty-five years ago the slogan “Break the silence on sexual violence!”
    echoed around Australia’s university campuses and streets. By 1991
    governments had been forced to at least appear to take the issue of violence
    against women seriously. The Victorian government developed a series of TV
    advertisements aimed at changing community attitudes about domestic
    violence. During the 1980s governments, police forces and official bodies
    had held an unprecedented number of enquiries and conferences into violence
    against women, increasingly concentrating on domestic violence. All kinds of
    task forces were set up in state police forces. Even the Australian Federal
    Police issued Domestic Violence: Notes for the Guidance of Police
    Officers!<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >3</a
      ></span
    >
    By 1993 domestic violence was a topic of discussion in the media. On 3 June
    <em>The Age</em> ran two headlines, “The war on women” and “Epidemic of
    violence”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >4</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    In the intervening two decades, significant shifts have occurred in the
    public discourse surrounding the issue of male violence against women. A
    2014 <em>Guardian</em> survey of police chiefs from every state found
    unanimous support amongst them for campaigns designed to “tackle” domestic
    violence and a willingness to acknowledge the inadequacies of police action
    in the past.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >5</a
      ></span
    >
    The then Victorian police commissioner Ken Lay blamed “a wider culture where
    vulgar and violent attitudes to women are common”. Most of them referred to
    the need to set up support systems and services for survivors of family
    violence.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >6</a
      ></span
    >
    None referred to where women walk at night or the clothes they wear – a far
    cry from the silence which had previously surrounded domestic violence or
    the old assumptions that women must have asked for it, or simply invented
    lies. Tony Abbott, known more for his in-your-face male chauvinism than
    support for women’s rights, made domestic violence an urgent priority for
    the Council of Australian Governments in April 2015 and appointed Ken Lay
    and the Australian of the Year Rosie Batty as founding members of an
    advisory panel on violence against women.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much has therefore changed with regard to domestic violence and the
    willingness of authorities to acknowledge it. Positive as this is in many
    ways, the focus on domestic violence does however create a distorted
    impression of the phenomenon of sexual violence in society overall, which
    can form an impediment to fully understanding the problem and how to address
    it. The evidence of widespread and varied abuse is incontrovertible: abuse
    among LGBTI intimate partners; abuse of children, the elderly, sick and
    mentally ill in schools, churches and other institutions charged with their
    care; male rape; male violence towards women in the armed forces; and the
    use of sexual intimidation and violence in regimes of war and torture. In
    this article I will argue that sexual violence against women can only be
    fully understood in the context of this much wider sexual abuse. When
    considering concrete evidence I will mostly draw on Australian experience,
    although some will be from the US, a country with comparable living
    standards and political traditions. While it is the case that violence
    against women is intractable in both Australia and the US, in countries
    where women’s rights are even less recognised and supported the levels of
    violence are often more extreme. A close comparative analysis would be
    needed in order to explain differences and similarities between different
    cultures and historical experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    I argue in this article that sexual abuse is deeply rooted in the structures
    of capitalism. Capitalism is a system in which commodity production and
    wealth creation is a process that dominates human beings, not one under our
    democratic control and subordinated to our needs. This is the social context
    in which the existence and prevalence of sexual violence has to be
    understood. In this context I explain why hierarchies of authority and
    status are all sites of abuse, and by examining sexuality under capitalism,
    I suggest why so much of that abuse is sexual. Capitalism is furthermore an
    unstable system of crisis, so I also look at the impact over the past three
    decades of neoliberalism, the key way in which the capitalist class has
    sought to cope with the end of the long post-war boom. This helps explain
    governments’ inadequate responses, and why they have not made any notable
    impact on the levels of sexual violence.

    This analysis points to what Marxists have always maintained, that while it
    may be possible to mitigate violence against women,<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >7</a
      ></span
    >
    it will never be eradicated while capitalism rules. A society without sexual
    violence, and one in which women are genuinely free and equal, will only be
    possible when capitalism is destroyed root and branch.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"

        >8</a
      ></span
    >
    The kinds of programs, campaigns and actions designed to completely
    eliminate sexual violence will therefore only be effective insofar as they
    help to contribute toward building the necessary class consciousness,
    solidarity and collective organisations which will be vital to achieving
    that end.
  </p>
  <h2>Why governments won’t really tackle domestic violence</h2>
  <p>
    At first glance it might seem that sexual violence and abuse is entrenched
    because of the silence in which it has traditionally been shrouded,
    particularly within the church and other institutions. But just breaking
    this silence has made very little difference. Regular media headlines and
    articles still proclaim there is an “epidemic” of family violence, and many
    suggest that it is getting worse.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >9</a
      ></span
    >
    It is very difficult to get a clear picture of the prevalence of sexual
    violence against women. Because the police have successfully convinced more
    women that complaints will be taken seriously, rates of reporting are
    increasing. But an increase in reporting does not necessarily correlate with
    an increase in actual instances of violence or abuse. Actual rates, and
    their accompanying trends, are notoriously difficult to measure. Some
    statistics are used in ways that do not distinguish between sexual and other
    forms of violence or family abuse. And researchers point out that even in
    private interviews many people will not admit to abuse, as it makes them
    feel ashamed, suffering from internalised ideas that they must have somehow
    contributed to it. For others, it still seems a private matter which they
    find difficult to discuss. In the<em> Guardian</em> survey above, contrary
    to most public statements and popular perceptions of escalating rates of
    violence, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Queensland claimed family
    violence assaults had declined in the last year. But whatever the underlying
    trend is, there is little evidence to suggest that levels of intimate
    partner violence have declined significantly over four decades, despite a
    number of reforms which have improved the position of women.
  </p>
  <p>
    Married women couldn’t work in the public service until 1966. Until the
    1970s women could not serve on a jury and could be paid less than a man
    doing the same job; divorce was very difficult, child care almost
    non-existent, single mothers were derided and the supporting mother’s
    benefit only became available in 1973. Women were clearly not equal
    citizens. The first women’s refuge, named Elsie, was only opened in inner
    Sydney in 1974. It is still very difficult for women to leave a violent man,
    but it was virtually impossible for most just three decades ago. Women’s
    participation in the paid workforce has steadily risen from 48 percent in
    1992 to 59.1 percent today, increasing the possibility of economic
    independence.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >10</a
      ></span
    >
    This indicates that the combination of propaganda to change men’s attitudes,
    the winning of some degree of formal equality for women and the
    establishment of basic services to help women leave violent relationships –
    all reforms Marxists and feminists argued were necessary to reduce sexual
    violence – appear to have made little difference. This needs some
    explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The radicalism of the late 1960s and 70s was imbued with optimism; it seemed
    that reform was inevitable, and struggles of the oppressed were pushing on a
    slightly ajar door which could be opened, even if it took something of a
    shove. But recession from 1975, attacks by the ruling class and a grossly
    inadequate political response by union leaders and the Labor Party resulted
    in a drastic decline in union membership – from about 54 percent of workers
    unionised to 17 percent today. This political offensive has created an
    increasingly depoliticised and right wing environment. This in turn lays the
    basis for the ruling class neoliberal agenda to more comprehensively impose
    right wing ideology, attack workers’ right to organise, and cut taxes on
    business. Cuts to government spending on welfare, health and education have
    put many families and individuals under increasing stress. These attacks
    also highlight how women’s oppression is structured into the system. The
    gender pay gap is widening, partly explained by the fact that 46.4 percent
    of women work only part time, making up nearly 70 percent of all part time
    workers, but also because industries where women are dominant tend to be
    lower paid than where men are clustered.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >11</a
      ></span
    >
    The result has been the redistribution of wealth from the working class to
    the capitalist class over the past four decades.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >12</a
      ></span
    >
    But this does not slake their thirst for more. The Abbott government’s class
    war budget of 2014 was a move to step up this process.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="" class="reference-body-link"

  <p>
    At the same time as governments talk about confronting family violence, line
    up for photo opportunities on White Ribbon Day, set up royal commissions,
    enquiries and inter-governmental conferences, they have been cutting and
    “restructuring” social services in ways which ensure family violence will
    continue unabated. This hypocrisy is the result of governments increasingly
    looking to opportunistically promote campaigns against sexual violence for
    their own purposes while at the same time implementing neoliberal policies
    of cuts and privatisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through these campaigns, the state can be portrayed as the protector of the
    moral integrity of society, and action against sexual violence can reinforce
    repressive measures such as harsher laws against perpetrators and more jails
    to accommodate the results. This fits with more general law and order
    campaigns which both reflect and reinforce the more right wing terrain in
    the absence of the resistance which was possible in the 1970s. But more than
    that, the gloss of “concern” and support for women against abhorrent crimes
    potentially increases the standing of the police in society. Governments
    sense it could boost their credibility to implement other reactionary
    policies. Because of the rightward trend within feminism, and with the left
    seriously weakened, there is virtually no pressure on them to implement
    policies which would actually make a difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this is reflected in the catalogue of government measures which
    undermine women’s independence and ability to get out of abusive
    relationships. The Abbott government allocated a paltry $16.7 million
    <em>over three years</em> to a National Awareness Campaign to Reduce
    Violence Against Women and their Children in the 2015 budget. Funding for
    homelessness and Aboriginal legal services amounting to a ludicrously
    inadequate $255.4 million give no security for these programs beyond two
    years.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >14</a
      ></span
    >
    This doesn’t make up for nearly $300 million of cuts to services which
    impact women escaping family violence.
  </p>
  <p>
    A summary of some of the consequences of cuts and neglect makes it clear.
    Australia-wide, half the women seeking places in refuges have to be housed
    temporarily in motels. The waiting time for a place is growing all the time
    because refuges are filled with women who can’t find affordable housing and
    have nowhere else to go. Five years ago, women in Victoria only had to wait
    one night in a motel; now they wait an average of five nights. Research
    shows that 50 percent of women who go to a motel room go back to the home
    they fled the next day because it’s just too difficult. Only three of every
    100 two bedroom rental lettings were affordable for a single parent living
    on welfare in the December 2014 quarter. There are no programs to change
    this situation, even though it is well known that lack of housing is one of
    the main reasons women can’t leave an abusive relationship. Yet the Abbott
    government cut funding to the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness
    by $44 million, with no budget allocated to it beyond 2015. If the
    partnership is cancelled, as many expect it to be, at least some
    homelessness services will be forced to close.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >15</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The NSW Liberal minister for women, Pru Goward, claimed in early 2015 that
    the government was tackling domestic violence through the “historic” It
    Stops Here reforms. A miserable $3.25 million a year was allocated and for
    only three years!<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >16</a
      ></span
    >
    What is “historic” is the fact that in its 2014 budget, funding for women’s
    refuges and specialist domestic violence and women’s homelessness services
    was slashed and “restructured”.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It is a deliberately convoluted and complex maze of changes – but the
      outcomes are crystal clear. At least 20 women’s refuges in Sydney, some
      operating for more than 40 years, and scores of other homelessness and
      women’s services across the state, have had their funding cut. What’s even
      more horrifying is that these cuts are just the latest. Over the past two
      years, 80 services have been lost; more than 400 providers of specialist
      women’s domestic violence and homelessness services have been reduced to
      fewer than 70.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="" class="reference-body-link"
          >17</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The outcome of this restructuring is truly shocking. Services were told they
    couldn’t bid, in a tender process they were all subjected to, for only those
    services they had been providing. Other than the 20 remaining women’s
    shelters the rest were mostly handed over to faith-based charities. Even the
    NSW assistant police commissioner, Mark Murdoch, voiced concerns: “It’s
    like, OK, we were making good use of that shelter, now we’ve got to find
    somewhere else to refer victims to.”<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >18</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Now abused women seeking a place in a refuge have to stand in line with all
    the homeless. In often flimsy structures, traumatised women, the mentally
    ill, even violent men are “sheltered” together. In Maitland, Jan McDonald,
    CEO of Carrie’s Place, which has been a refuge for 35 years, told the
    <em>Maitland Mercury</em> of the consequences of not being permitted to
    offer a women-only refuge. Women and men from the same family have had to be
    taken in. Almost immediately they had the situation where a man “turned
    around and boasted to the female, ‘Ha ha, they’re helping me as well.’”<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >19</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    We could add many more examples. Cuts to any number of services which may
    not seem directly relevant have a cascading effect. “Restructuring” (read
    cuts) of Medicare Locals by the Abbott government reduced them from 61 to 31
    across Australia. Many have been subsumed into “super regions”, with some
    relocated many kilometres away, making them inaccessible. Many of the Locals
    fund grassroots centres which provide things like “anger management for men”
    and programs to improve understanding of issues related to sexual violence
    and sex education for young people.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >20</a
      ></span
    >
    At the same time as all these cuts are being imposed in the name of
    “balancing budgets”, both Liberal and Labor governments have maintained
    determined support for the notoriously right wing chaplaincy program in
    schools to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars – a program which
    promotes the sexist stereotypes, homophobia and backward attitudes towards
    sex which help fuel sexual violence not just towards women, but also LGBTI
    people, children and many others in vulnerable circumstances.<span

      ><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="" class="reference-body-link"

      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Governments can’t claim to simply misunderstand the issues. That bastion of
    reaction, the Productivity Commission, urged state, territory and federal
    governments to increase funding to legal services by $200 million, and the
    Allen Consulting report, commissioned by the Abbott government, found
    funding for legal assistance was already inadequate to meet the government’s
    own objectives. Yet Michael Smith, the CEO of Victoria’s Eastern Community
    Legal Centre, told Fairfax media: “Family violence is about a third of all
    the work that community legal centres are doing across the country, so it’s
    a bit hollow to talk about family violence being a national priority while
    you’re cutting funding out of these services.” Fourteen centres in Victoria
    alone lost federal funding after the Abbott government slashed $20 million
    from community legal centres.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  </p>
  <p>
    It goes without saying that cuts to services to Indigenous communities make
    an already tragic situation worse. Indigenous women are said to be 31 times
    more likely to be victims of domestic violence than non-Indigenous. Family
    Violence Prevention Legal Services (FVPLS), the only program of its kind
    dedicated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander victims of family
    violence, suffered a $3.6 million cut in Abbott’s 2014 budget. In December
    2014, when FVPLS became the responsibility of prime minister Abbott, it was
    effectively defunded and has no guarantee of any future funding.<span

    The priorities of the system are not the needs of the oppressed and are not
    geared to improving workers’ conditions or giving people more control over
    their lives. Profit and the power of the ruling class are the priority.
    Today that means more cuts, fewer rights and less say over their lives for
    workers and the oppressed. Women’s oppression is a key plank in the armoury
    which underpins the system. And so sexual abuse of women is tied closely to
    the structures, needs and priorities of capitalism.<span

    We will see below that the other manifestations of sexual violence are also
    the result of this logic.

  <h2>Evolving understanding of sexual assault</h2>
  <p>
    Before the 1970s women’s movement, most theorists had suggested that rape
    was a perversion, that rapists were mentally ill, some that the rapists’
    behaviour was the result of socialisation by a strong maternal figure or a
    weak father figure; all painted a picture of individuals unable to control
    their sexual and aggressive impulses, or with fears of castration,
    homosexual tendencies and so on. As Donat and D’Emilio conclude: “The focus
    was on understanding the plight of the man… (the woman’s) victimization was
    simply a by-product of his pathology.”

    Over four decades, feminists’, Marxists’ and other theorists’ views about
    sexual violence have continually changed. Early writings of second-wave
    feminism did not deal with violence against women in any systematic
    way.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Simone de Beauvoir in The Second Sex<em> – </em>which was in a lot of ways a
    challenge to the prevalent ideas about women – argued that virtually all
    sexual relations between men and women constituted violence. She uses all
    the language of the gender stereotypes of man the strong, forceful partner,
    women passive, dominated, submissive: the woman is “taken”, she is
    “invaded”, she “yields” to men’s sexual advances.<span

    For de Beauvoir “the female…is the prey of the species”.<span

    Susan Brownmiller, a radical feminist, broke the silence on rape with her
    book <em>Against Our Will</em>, published in 1975. She states that until a
    discussion of rape she attended in 1970 she thought “rape wasn’t a feminist
    issue”, and that “the women’s movement had nothing in common with rape
    victims”.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Diana Russell writes that even in the eighties, feminists in the US were
    reluctant to take up the question of rape in marriage.<span

      ><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >30</a
      ></span
    >
    When she did eventually deal with the subject, Brownmiller made a crudely
    reductionist argument. Women, she asserted, are physiologically vulnerable
    to sexual attack, and once “men discovered that they could rape, they
    proceeded to do it”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >31</a
      ></span
    >
    Apart from her serious theoretical errors and historically inaccurate
    claims, she based her arguments on police records, focusing on stranger
    danger. But research soon revealed that most sexual abuse of women was
    perpetrated by men they knew – family members, friends, neighbours – and
    that most violence against women occurs within the walls of the family
    home.<span class="floating-ref-link"

        >32</a
      ></span
    >
    Nevertheless, in spite of a slow beginning and theoretical weaknesses,
    debates within the women’s movement established the view of male rape of
    women as the result of our sexist culture. Some Marxists went further,
    arguing it was the result of the structures of capitalism and alienation,
    with sexism the ideological reflection of them.<span

  <h2>The reality of sexual violence</h2>
  <p>
    Today, enquiries into churches and every institution in which the vulnerable
    are placed for care have revealed the hard cold fact that sexual abuse of
    children, both female and male, and of the elderly, disabled and those
    suffering mental ill health is rife in all of them. A clearer view of this
    widespread sexual abuse is essential for a full understanding of gendered
    sexual abuse and devising strategies for dealing with it. As I write the
    Royal Commission on Institutional Child Sexual Abuse is hearing horrific
    evidence of a paedophile ring of Catholic priests in Ballarat, Victoria.
    Jesuits, Christian Brothers, nuns and others in positions of authority in
    Catholic institutions abused and traumatised large numbers of children in
    the church’s schools and parishes possibly since the 1940s, definitely
    during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. One third of one witness’s class have
    since committed suicide, part of a widespread pattern which emphasises the
    endemic sexual abuse suffered by unknown numbers of young boys and
    girls.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >34</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    By its own admission, between 1996 and 2013 the church distributed $48
    million in compensation to victims. Given that the average compensation
    payout (based on Victorian figures) is about $36,000, this in effect is an
    admission of well over a thousand sexual abuse cases. More than 2,200 had
    approached the program for compensation by mid-2015, and many thousands of
    new claims by both male and female victims are likely to result from the
    royal commission.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >35</a
      ></span
    >
    With denials and cover-ups by the church, the defence of abusers by the
    likes of Cardinal George Pell and bullying of victims, who is to say it has
    ended? Similar patterns have been revealed by enquiries into the
    institutions of the Protestant churches, Jewish schools and the Salvation
    Army. Children are still removed by governments from families said to be at
    risk and dumped into situations where, testimonies in all enquiries would
    indicate, they are very likely to suffer sexual abuse.
  </p>
  <p>
    A number of studies of child abuse in Australia between 2001 and 2010 were
    summarised by the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS). They were
    based on interviews with adults ranging in ages from 18 to 59. All these
    researchers asked about non-penetrative and penetrative sexual abuse.
    Non-penetrative abuse of girls ranged from 20.6 to 33.6 percent, of boys
    from 10.5 to 15.9 percent. Females reported penetration at rates of 7.9 to
    12 percent and males 4.0 to 7.5 percent.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >36</a
      ></span
    >
    Another survey conducted in 2001 found similar patterns if you compare women
    and men: “Non-penetrative CSA was twice as common among women (33.6%) than
    men (15.9%). Approximately 12% of women and 4% of men reported unwanted
    penetrative experiences.” However researchers noted that older men were more
    likely to report abuse than young, and of women who had had intercourse
    before 16 older women were more likely than young to say it was
    non-consensual. This was taken to imply that child sex abuse rates were
    possibly declining, but that is most likely too much of an assumption,
    especially since the finding is not substantiated by later surveys.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >37</a
      ></span
    >
    Another weakness of the research not mentioned in the AIFS report is that
    the sex or relationship to the child of perpetrators (family members,
    teachers, priest etc.) was not listed. In spite of the difficulties, these
    findings, more clinical than the anecdotal evidence brought to life by the
    royal commission, indicate that sexual abuse of children is not
    insignificant and could well be more prevalent than the figures suggest.

  <p>The LGBTI website Same Same reports:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It is colloquially considered that the LGBTI community suffers domestic
      violence at similar rates to the straight community. The data from ACON
      notes that 41 percent of lesbians and 28 percent of same sex attracted men
      have experienced some form of abuse in a relationship, combining this with
      61.8 percent of transgender men and 42.9 percent of intersex women.<span

  <p>
    A 2008 Victorian study found that 26 percent of LGBTI respondents had
    experienced such abuse. Other research indicates that the gender
    stereotypes, homophobia and transphobia all create pressures which
    contribute to levels of abuse and difficulties in ending it. Women report
    more intimate partner violence than gay men. However it can be more
    difficult for men to admit the abuse for reasons related to the stereotype
    of masculinity and in particular of gay men:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      (S)exual coercion among gay men has been regarded as virtually oxymoronic.
      Dominant discourses of masculinity and male sexuality…render the
      possibility that sex could be unwanted for men as an almost unthinkable
      proposition.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  </blockquote>
  <p>Bianca Fileborn, an AIFS researcher, commented that some authors</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      have argued that…homophobia and heterosexism are the key distinguishing
      factors between violence in heterosexual and GLBTIQ relationships, both in
      terms of the ability of perpetrators to exploit these to their advantage,
      and in terms of forming unique barriers to the recognition and reporting
      of violence in GLBTIQ relationships.

      Feminist theory on sexual violence has, by and large, excluded the

      (and particularly lesbian relationships, which have at times been depicted
      as a kind of “utopia” for women) by almost exclusively focusing on or
      conceptualising sexual violence as something done by men to women. To some

    We can also say it has led to male rape being a seriously under-researched
    area. It has become clear that the rates of sexual abuse men experience is
    possibly considerably higher than previously recognised. For one thing, the
    problem researchers have in interviews and under-reporting to police are
    known to be even more pronounced among men. But researchers have paid little
    attention to the possibility of men’s experience of sexual abuse. This is
    partly a result of the inadequate understanding of rape. In debates among
    feminists, the word “rape” has been interpreted by almost everyone in too
    narrow a sense, as if there is rape, full stop: penetration of a vagina by a
    penis. This ignores the multiple kinds of rape and the specificity of
    different circumstances of rape.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    As Lynne Segal argues against feminists like Susan Griffin and Brownmiller

    of men, and men are raped by other men.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Until 2012 the FBI defined rape as a crime <em>only</em> committed against
    women. This raises the possibility that rape of men is more prevalent than
    thought, at least in the US where this definition informed research.<span

    The enthusiasm for this topic by reactionary men’s groups has cast a shadow
    which discouraged left wing researchers from admitting that men are abused
    and that some women abuse. Nevertheless the dominant gender stereotype of
    the aggressive, dominating man encouraged us to think of men as less likely
    to be victims, unlike “submissive” women. Even much feminist research was
    impacted by these assumptions and anyone such as the socialist feminists
    Lynne Segal and Linda Gordon who acknowledged both that men are raped and
    that women can be sexual abusers was greeted with hostility.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a 2008 article Segal mentions 200 pieces of research over the last few
    decades which concluded that “women are as physically aggressive, or more
    aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male
    partners”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >44</a
      ></span
    >
    Twenty years earlier Linda Gordon had written that “in certain circumstances
    women were quite as likely as men to use physical violence against partners
    or children”. Also unpopular was her stress on “poverty and other forms of
    material deprivation and cultural dislocation” as contributing factors in
    domestic violence.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    This was thought to distract from understanding male dominance. And it has
    been the case that for decades most theorists have unquestioningly assumed
    that sexual abuse is a means of male domination of women. But this
    definition does not equip us to understand the role of women in something
    like the torture at the Abu Ghraib prison, which happened while General
    Janis Karpinski was in command. US soldiers, about half of whom were women,
    participated in practices which included rape, but also other sexually
    charged methods of humiliation, of both men and women. Male prisoners were
    forced into poses that could be photographed to simulate oral sex.
    Humiliations included being forced to wear women’s underwear, or to
    masturbate in front of their tormentors. Lynndie England, whose laughing
    poses in the midst of this sexual torture became a central image associated
    with the exposure of US soldiers’ crimes, would later say in court that the
    poses and acts were all for the fun of the soldiers and she didn’t think it
    was wrong. The fact that the soldiers uploaded images of these outrages to
    the internet gives weight to her statements, even though she later retracted
    them at her retrial.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  </p>
  <p>
    It is the case though that researchers such as Richard Gelles, much quoted
    by men’s groups who argue that the incidents of domestic violence are fairly
    equal between women and men, points out that the levels of harm inflicted by
    men are significantly worse, leaving women with more serious injuries. While
    homicide is not an indicator of the levels of ongoing abuse, homicide
    statistics do back up Gelles’s argument. Of the 877 homicides reported in
    NSW over 10 years to 2010, 108 were women killed by their intimate partners.
    Over the whole ten years, “there were no cases where a woman was a domestic
    violence abuser who killed a male domestic violence victim”.<span

    Nevertheless, as Segal argues against her critics:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The point is that admitting the existence of women’s aggression does not
      in any way contradict the cultural reality that “masculinity” is signified
      in terms of practices of physical strength, assertiveness and dominance
      over women.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  <p>
    A National Crime Victimization Survey of 2012-13 in the US found that in
    40,000 households, 38 percent of those who experienced sexual abuse of some
    kind were men and 46 percent of them claimed the perpetrator was a woman. It
    does not serve women’s interests to bury the facts, nor to deny men who
    experience abuse the support they need, simply because these findings jar
    with common perceptions or expectations about abuse.<span

    Publication of these figures caused an outraged storm from those who are
    involved in campaigning for women violated by men. However, ideas about
    sexual abuse have evolved over many decades as research has shone a light on
    dark corners of people’s lives, challenging preconceived ideas. When the
    feminist legal scholar Lara Stemple read the NCVS report she rang to query
    their results. Perhaps they had made a mistake? Now we have the results of
    an exhaustive two years’ study and research by her and Ilan Meyer, published
    in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>, which found “widespread
    sexual victimization among men in the United States”. This is not the
    well-known anti-feminist “men’s rights” propaganda. On the contrary, their
    ground-breaking research is described by them as explicitly based on
    “feminist principles that emphasize equity, inclusion, and intersectional
    approaches; the importance of understanding power relations; and the
    imperative to question gender assumptions”. They argue:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The sexual victimization of women was ignored for centuries. Although it
      remains tolerated and entrenched in many pockets of the world, feminist
      analysis has gone a long way toward revolutionizing thinking about the
      sexual abuse of women, demonstrating that sexual victimization is rooted
      in gender norms and is worthy of social, legal and public health
      intervention. We have aimed to build on this important legacy by drawing
      attention to <em>male</em> sexual victimization, an overlooked area of
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take a fresh look at several recent findings concerning male sexual
      victimization, exploring explanations for the persistent misperceptions
      surrounding it.

  </blockquote>
  <p>They conclude:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      (D)epictions of sexual victimization reinforce the stereotypical sexual
      victimization paradigm, comprising male perpetrators and female victims.
      As we demonstrate, the reality concerning sexual victimization and gender
      is more complex.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Sexual violence towards men in prisons is now the subject of research in the
    US, where such huge numbers of men are incarcerated it could not be ignored
    any longer. An article by Jill Filipovic in <em>The Guardian</em> was titled
    “Is the US the only country where more men are raped than women?” indicating
    the enormity of the issue coming to light with preliminary research.<span

    Partly it reflects the horrendous numbers of men in prison in the US. In
    Australia the issue of sexual assault in prisons remains under-researched.
    David Heilpern has done the only serious research into male rape in jail
    that I have seen. He found that over a quarter of those he interviewed
    reported that they had been sexually assaulted. More than half said that
    they had been threatened with sexual assault.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Not only is the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse now revealed, but all
    the evidence shows that supposedly respectable institutions, believed to be
    pillars of a decent society, take extraordinary measures such as threats,
    manoeuvres, millions of dollars thrown at legal battles or offers of bribes,
    to silence survivors. Hundreds of thousands of people over two hundred years
    in white Australia have looked the other way – that is if they were not
    complicit in the crimes. Sexual violence – not just between intimate
    partners, not just towards women or adults but towards every vulnerable or
    oppressed group – is endemic in this society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sexual violence against women is not happening in isolation from these
    widespread examples. This raises fundamental issues: why do people sexually
    abuse those in their care, and why do respectable institutions turn a blind
    eye? To answer we need to turn to the totality of the capitalist system and
    the consequences of how it is organised.

    Put simply, all the oppression and horrors we see around us arise from the
    basic fact of exploitation of the working class by capital and the
    particular way that is carried out. Analyses which consider questions in
    isolation remain partial explanations, because they offer only a description
    of this “enchanted, perverted, topsy-turvy world” divorced from the
    underlying structures.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    If we want to understand sexual violence we need to start with the most
    basic fact of capitalism and develop a picture of the structures and social
    relations, the ideologies and state practices which make such widespread
    abuse possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The exploitation capitalism rests on gives rise to the oppression of the
    working class. Because this oppression exists for the vast majority, it is
    invisible compared with the bigotry and discrimination experienced by groups
    who are recognised as suffering specific oppression. But rule by a minority
    means the working class must be systematically excluded from any real
    decision-making <em>as a class</em>. And as John Lennon’s savage lyrics sum
    up, it’s much more deeply embedded in working class experience than simply
    economic or political decision-making. How could a tiny minority live by
    exploiting the vast majority if those who produce the wealth were
    self-confident, with a sense of self-worth? Lillian Rubin, an American
    writer, summed up the experience of this oppression and hinted at some of
    its consequences in her book
    <em>Worlds of Pain: Life in the Working-Class Family</em>:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Children know. They know when their teachers are contemptuous of their
      family… They know there are no factory workers, no truck drivers, no
      construction workers who are the heroes of the television shows they
      watch. They know their parents are not those who “count”… And perhaps most
      devastating of all, they know that their parents know these things as
      well… Why else would they carry within them so much anger – anger that
      lashes out irrationally at home, anger that is displaced from the world
      outside where its expression is potentially dangerous?<span
        class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title="" class="reference-body-link"
          >55</a

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Under capitalism, particular groups such as women, indigenous people,
    migrants, LGBTI people, religious minorities, children, the elderly and the
    disabled suffer specific oppressions which divide workers in a myriad of
    ways, subjecting some people to multiple oppressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the fact that this is a system based on the universal production
    of commodities has profound implications for human relationships and the way
    society is organised. The mass of producers is divested of any control over
    the means of production; workers’ ability to work is itself turned into a
    commodity, its price set on a market and paid for by the hour. Workers
    labour, not to produce what they need, but to receive a wage. This very
    activity, which should be creative and life-affirming, becomes nothing but
    drudgery, producing wealth for those who dominate our lives, and in fact
    increasing their power over us. The products of workers’ labour stand as
    <em>alien </em>objects, as a power beyond and opposed to them. This
    <em>alienation </em>means that for the worker, life appears to be dominated
    by the products of their labour. It seems as though our lives are under the
    control of alien, uncontrollable forces such as “the economy” and “the
    market”. In Marx’s words:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The <em>devaluation</em> of the human world grows in direct proportion to
      the <em>increase in value</em> of the world of things. Labour not only
      produces commodities; it also produces itself and the workers as a
      <em>commodity</em>.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title="" class="reference-body-link"
          >56</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The fact that everything is exchanged, not between those who make things,
    but on the impersonal market, obscures how capitalism works. Working to
    produce commodities for a market obscures the social connections between
    those who make them and those who eventually will use them. Workers have no
    say over what is produced and extremely little over what they will produce.
    They generally don’t have the luxury of deciding they would prefer to make
    something useful such as solar panels rather than say weapons. And so “the
    social character of men’s labour appears to them as an objective character
    stamped upon the products of their labour… (A) definite social relation
    between men…assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between
    things.”<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >57</a
      ></span
    >
    As Marx argued early in chapter one of <em>Capital</em>, so he concludes
    near the end of the third volume. “In capital…we have the complete
    mystification of the capitalist mode of production, the conversion of social
    relations into things”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >58</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    This results in the estrangement of one human being from another, and the
    world is experienced as alien and fragmented. As Bertell Ollman says, “the
    whole has broken up into numerous parts whose interrelation to the whole can
    no longer be ascertained. This is the essence of alienation.” This
    “splintering of human nature into a number of misbegotten parts”,
    <span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >59</a
      ></span
    >
    and the actual domination of capital over our lives, creates in the
    exploited feelings of powerlessness and throws a veil of mystification over
    the structures of exploitation. The market, plus the fact that our ability
    to labour is a commodity, paid not for the quality or usefulness of what we
    do but by the hour, obscures how capitalism works. Therefore it is difficult
    to reject the dominant ideas of capitalism – common sense ideas which seem
    to reflect experience, such as we need bosses to organise society, we are
    all individuals, responsible for what we make of our lives, women are not
    suitable to run state affairs, the only “natural” sexual relationship is
    heterosexual and so on. This explains why the mass of people accept some
    version of ruling class ideology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Marx further develops our understanding of this system “whose inherent laws
    impose themselves only as the mean of apparently lawless irregularities”.
    Who knows whether the actual social value, measured by the amount of labour
    necessary for its production, actually corresponds to its price on the
    market? Unlike in a simple barter system it is not predictable. And so
    “price ceases altogether to express value. Objects that in themselves are no
    commodities, such as conscience, honour, etc., are capable of being offered
    for sale.”<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >60</a
      ></span
    >
    And so everything in capitalism can be turned into a commodity to be bought
    and sold, including leisure, the <em>promise</em> of or actual sexual
    gratification for a price, even prestige and status. The care of the
    vulnerable is up for sale and profit, as are even torture and persecution.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are those who argue that alienation affects everyone and so cannot
    explain something like sexual abuse because not everyone is abused. It’s
    true that alienation is not just about individual experience, it is an
    overarching, all-pervasive condition of capitalism. That is precisely why it
    is our starting point, not because every individual or group act can be read
    off this insight in some reductionist, mechanical way. But it provides a
    basic explanation of why such behaviours can occur at all and why abuse is
    not just a gendered phenomenon, but can take many forms. Marx’s method is to
    rise from the abstract to the concrete. The concrete, especially in
    capitalism, where the social structures are so obscured, can only be
    understood in a theoretical framework. The mediating factors which influence
    how this alienation is expressed and experienced must be investigated in
    order to understand sexual abuse. We have to analyse factors such as the
    role of stereotypes of women as sex objects to be controlled and used to
    satisfy men’s needs, the socialisation of men to assume their entitlement to
    dominate others, the promotion by those in positions of authority and
    influence of homophobia, transphobia, prurient attitudes to sex,
    discrimination against the disabled and so on. The role of the family,
    institutions which have influence and control over the vulnerable,
    ideologies which justify some forms of abuse all have to be understood in
    the context of a particular society, its traditions, levels of class
    consciousness, the state of the class struggle. Nothing is timeless or
    unchanging.
  </p>
  <p>
    Georg Lukács, in his <em>History and Class Consciousness</em>, provides an
    important exposition of the Marxist concept of alienation. As part of that
    he explains how state bureaucracies and hierarchical institutions flatten
    all human relationships and deaden human empathy. The system as a whole has
    to rely on calculations and rationalisations; workers become little more
    than measurements of time – the half timers, the full timer. For example the
    royal commission into child abuse strips any identity from those recounting
    their trauma and puts the perpetrators and those who hid their crimes on a
    par with their victims by referring to “stakeholders”. The response by
    institutions to accusations of abuse is notable for its inhumanity. For
    example, the Catholic church, which promotes itself as concerned with the
    spiritual and temporal wellbeing of its followers, can’t respond in a human,
    caring way to people who are clearly traumatised by the brutality of its
    paedophile priests. According to Broken Rites, the aim of its Towards
    Healing program is not to monetarily compensate victims, but “is really a
    business strategy, designed to protect the church’s assets and its corporate
    image”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >61</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Hierarchies of authority demand order and regulation so they put some people
    in charge over others with the responsibility for keeping order,
    disciplining those who do not easily submit to their authority. But the
    market relations, the system of commodity production and competition are
    unstable, contradictory and wracked by regular crises. This “requires that
    every manifestation of life” must exhibit the fact that individuals are
    dominated by capital; that they “are but part of a mechanism that belongs to
    the capitalist”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >62</a
      ></span
    >
    The “workers’ fate is typical of society as a whole in that this
    self-objectification, this transformation of a human function into a
    commodity reveals in all its starkness the dehumanised and dehumanising
    function of the commodity relation”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >63</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    In the context of this toxic mix, we can begin to consider why violent,
    controlling, authoritarian behaviour is possible where some people have
    authority and control over the vulnerable and oppressed. The abuse is not
    just the product of dysfunctional individuals. People are turned into
    predators when they play an oppressive role in a hierarchy. They become
    tools for the ideological role that enforcers of a bureaucracy are meant to
    live out. Their actions are not seen as anti-human, just “necessary”. Think
    of the minister and officials in the immigration department; for them
    refugees and immigrants are just objects to control and use for political
    purposes. Most institutions, like churches or schools or prisons, are
    founded on the basis of formal rationalism. This is what Foucault is talking
    about in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>: they strictly regiment life, in the
    name of “bettering” the people who are subject to their authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, there is an assumption that people are rational machines,
    which they are obviously not. Hence, at least some of those in these
    institutions are somewhat resentful, and at times resist. The guards or
    instructors come to resent their charges and dehumanise them. But also, the
    people in charge of a hierarchy have to <em>appear </em>as though they are
    paragons of enlightened rationality and discipline. This means that the
    people who uphold a hierarchy are just as reified (Lukács’s term) as those
    who are subordinated to it – with an important difference being that their
    livelihood and social status is tied up with their reification.
  </p>
  <h2>Why <em>sexual</em> abuse?</h2>
  <p>But why does <em>sexual</em> intimidation and abuse occur so widely?</p>
  <p>
    Alienation exists to some extent in all class societies because the
    producers don’t control all of their production. This is taken to an extreme
    in the capitalist system. This alienation is experienced and expressed in
    different ways. Marx and Engels identified humans’ ability to
    <em>labour</em> – using tools, changing ourselves as we change the world
    around us – as what separates humans from the animal world, at the same time
    as we remain part of that natural world. Sexuality is also part of human
    nature.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >64</a
      ></span
    >
    As humans evolved from the apes, tool-making changed those apes into
    qualitatively different animals. The development of a sociable, cooperative
    being was accompanied by an evolution in how it experienced sex. Human
    sexuality evolved in ways which involved a higher degree of pleasure than
    the apes we evolved from, something indulged in at any time and not
    subordinated to the needs of procreation. To see sexuality as part of human
    nature is not to say that the way humans experience sex, how we experience
    sexuality or exercise our ability to labour, are inextricable from some
    inner, unchanging soul. Every society constructs the way sexuality is
    understood and experienced depending on how production and reproduction are
    organised,<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >65</a
      ></span
    >
    just as it does our ability to labour. So for instance, same-sex desire has
    clearly existed throughout human history, but has been interpreted and
    experienced in radically different ways. It was only with the rise of
    capitalism, a mode of production in which the notion of ourselves as
    individuals is intrinsic to the dominant ideology, that the concept of the
    “homosexual” individual emerged. Because sexuality, like all aspects of
    humans’ experience, is socially constructed. As John D’Emilio comments:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      (S)ome historians have discarded the view that sexuality is primarily a
      biological category, an innate, unchanging “drive” or “instinct” immune
      from the shifts that characterize other aspects of social organization.
      Instead, as a number of writers have argued, eroticism is also subject to
      the forces of culture. Human beings learn how to express themselves
      sexually, and the content of that learning is as varied as the societies
      that women and men have formed through the ages.<span
        class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title="" class="reference-body-link"

      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Followers of Michel Foucault usually assume the two concepts – human nature
    and social construction – are counterposed. But by the end of his life,
    Foucault was grappling with the concept of an enduring human nature, which
    he introduced into his philosophy. He did not think this negated his thesis
    that sexuality is socially constructed. Rather it more fully completed his
    philosophy.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title="" class="reference-body-link"

  </p>
  <p>
    Foucault, with whom I disagree on questions of power and the anti-humanism
    which permeates much of his work, has nonetheless provided us with a useful
    framework to understand sexuality in capitalist society. In his
    <em>History of Sexuality Volume 1 </em>he outlines the specificity of
    sexuality under the bourgeoisie by way of an historical account of how their
    concepts became dominant. He argues that the bourgeoisie could not rule by
    virtue of blood lines and inherited right. So they were obsessed with the
    healthy regeneration of their class.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >68</a
      ></span
    >
    As a result, this rising bourgeoisie in early capitalism attributed to sex
    “a mysterious and undefined power; it staked its life and its death on sex,
    by making it responsible for its future welfare; it subordinated its soul to
    sex”. The development of this sexuality involved endless discussion of sex,
    the pathologising of so-called perversions, psychiatric explanations.
    Educational institutions “delineated areas of extreme sexual saturation”.
    And “(t)he family was…the misfortune of sex”. Endless discussion and
    agonising created the image of the “hysterical woman”, the “Malthusian
    couple” and the perverse adult. It generated theories of children’s
    sexuality as both threatening and unnatural, and about the dangers of
    masturbation. A list of prohibitions was articulated “to expel from reality
    the forms of sexuality that were not amenable to the strict economy of
    reproduction”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >69</a

  </p>
  <p>
    At first they gave little thought to the exploited masses; but by the
    mid-nineteenth century, enfeeblement from appalling conditions threatened
    the very reproduction of labour power, capitalism’s most important
    commodity. And the working class began to demonstrate its ability to
    challenge the power of their capitalist rulers. And so the bourgeois ideas
    of sex and sexuality were deployed for “controlling whole populations in an
    increasingly comprehensive way”.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    albeit expressed in different terms. And his description of the consequences
    for individuals echoes the Marxist conception of alienation:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      From this interplay there has evolved…a knowledge of the subject; a
      knowledge not so much of his form, but of that which divides him,
      determines him perhaps, but above all causes him to be ignorant of
      himself.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    While work is drudgery, unemployed workers talk about feeling useless and
    demeaned, their life force drains from them and they suffer anguish. But
    with sex it’s different. Sex <em>can </em>be experienced and practised in
    fulfilling ways in which people relate through sexual activity on more than
    a physical level, in ways that are not reduced to genitals. But because sex
    and our sexuality, like everything else, is turned into a commodity, bought
    and sold, used to sell things, there is also a high degree of alienation of
    this aspect of our human nature. This turns our body into an object, sex is
    objectified, and sexual pleasure separated from human interaction.
    Furthermore, the regulation of sexual behaviour through the formal and
    informal rules governing marriage and the family further constrains and
    removes control of sexuality from human beings, creating in the process a
    distinction between “illicit” and “legitimate” forms of sexual expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    Foucault conveys why sex and abuse are entwined: “What is peculiar to modern
    societies, in fact, is not that they consigned sex to a shadow existence,
    but that they dedicated themselves to speaking of it <em>ad infinitum</em>,
    while exploiting it as <em>the</em> secret.”<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >73</a
      ></span
    >
    And “The power which thus took charge of sexuality set about contacting
    bodies, caressing them with its eyes, intensifying areas, electrifying
    surfaces, dramatizing troubled moments… These attractions, these evasions,
    these circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes…perpetual
    spirals of power and pleasure.”<span class="floating-ref-link"

    The reified perpetrators of institutional sexual violence are expected to
    assert their domination and control, which in itself gives them the excuse
    to take out their own frustrations on those they supervise, or encourages
    the assumption they have the right to satisfy their own sexual urges while
    belittling and demoralising their charges. Society does not openly endorse
    this behaviour, creating an aura of secrecy which mirrors the privacy of
    most sexual activity, thus eroticising the exercise of power. I think
    Foucault’s perceptive comments indicate how people can perceive that sexual
    assault is felt as more demeaning than a bashing or other forms of control:
    “sex (is) that agency which appears to dominate us and that secret which
    seems to underlie all that we are.”<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title="" class="reference-body-link"

  <p>
    The anguish in the stories of agony and suicide which plague the lives of
    those abused as children or women who have been abused in relationships is
    palpable, as is widespread horror at the use of sexual abuse in torture;
    whereas there does not appear to be anything like this impact from the often
    severe beatings of boys before corporal punishment was outlawed, men bashing
    each other in drunken brawls and the like. The trope which encapsulates
    men’s experience in jail is the fear of rape – seen as the worst that can
    happen to a man. It is fed by homophobia but also the closely related
    humiliation of being reduced to the status of a woman. So sexual abuse, or
    even the threat of it, can be a way of imposing power more thoroughly,
    devastating the victims’ will to resist, than other forms of discipline or
    punishment in institutional situations, or a way of exerting personal
    control in a relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    The position of workers in institutional bureaucracies is wracked with
    contradictions. Those expected to exercise control lack any real power
    themselves, subject as they are to the whims of bureaucracy, government
    cuts, threats of sackings, low pay and all the other indignities workers
    suffer. The secrecy which surrounds abuse is not unlike the privacy of the
    home, a sphere of life which provides an immunity from discovery. At every
    level it is understood these abuses should not really happen, while they are
    tolerated and actively covered up, and whistle-blowers rather than abusers
    are victimised. So priests, prison guards, school teachers and so on,
    insofar as they embody a strict, disciplinarian lifestyle, may well be
    miserable and unsatisfied themselves. Because their role trains them to
    treat people like objects, it is a short jump for them to treat people as
    the objects of their own impulses – frustration, anger or sexual need. There
    can be a fine line between ignoring the needs of the person under their
    authority, psychological or physical coercion and sexual abuse of all kinds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the structural limits to individual choice and the dynamic in
    bureaucracies towards dehumanisation, it’s a point of optimism about
    humanity that not everyone trying to keep the order and discipline they’re
    expected to maintain ends up abusing those in their “care” or under their
    authority. Even those in authoritarian positions of domination are not just
    robotic creations of the hierarchy. We are not just objects of social
    structures, we do still have the capacity for subjective reflection and
    action. Some at least hold on to some sense of responsibility to protect the
    people in the institutions they staff. In an interesting exercise in 2001,
    women activists from the Queensland-based Sisters Inside took over the
    platform at a conference of correctional personnel working in women’s
    prisons:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      (S)ome (women) playing guards, others playing the roles of prisoners,
      dramatized a strip search…the gathering was so repulsed by this enactment
      of a practice that occurs routinely in women’s prisons everywhere that
      many of the participants felt compelled to dissociate themselves from such
      practices, insisting that this was not what they did. Some of the
      guards…simply cried upon watching representations of their own actions
      outside the prison context.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    As Amanda George commented in a documentary on the subject, “without the
    uniform, without the power of the state, (the strip search) would be sexual

    Outside the situation created by institutional hierarchy those with
    authority over others may have quite different attitudes and responses. They
    are not just monsters with no subjectivity. And so some can be convinced not
    to ill-treat those they supervise, and others never do. Factors such as
    ideas of class solidarity, commitment to human rights and their own
    experiences of oppression also influence how they act out their role.

  <h2>The state and sexual violence</h2>
  <p>
    There are many ways sexual violence is openly and deliberately used by the
    state to instil fear, to denigrate and humiliate oppressed minorities and to
    impose authority. Rape of women in police cells is rightly feared. Angela
    Davis showed that worldwide, “(s)exual abuse is surreptitiously incorporated
    into one of the most habitual aspects of women’s imprisonment, the strip
    search”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >77</a
      ></span
    >
    Amanda George and Debbie Kilroy, activists with Sisters Inside argue:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Mandatory strip searching is experienced in a discriminatory manner by
      women prisoners. Women prisoners, as a group, have a higher incidence of
      previous history of sexual assault than the general community and they
      often experience strip searching as a new assault. There is no evidence
      that mandatory strip searching actually carries out its stated purpose,
      the prevention of contraband. Any strip search is an unjustified assault
      on women prisoners by the state.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    </p>
    <p>
      In regimes of torture sexual humiliation and violence are common, as are
      threats of such violence against the families of those being tortured.
      Touching genitals, rape using guns and other instruments, so-called rectal
      feeding, which is nothing but anal rape, are all documented. In the
      notorious Abu Ghraib prison we saw several aspects coming together. In
      actions designed to induce fear, humiliation and demoralisation, male US
      soldiers raped young boys in front of their mothers while female soldiers
      filmed them. Rape of women and girls, as a weapon of war, is entrenched –
      from the US in Vietnam in the 1960s to Bosnia and Herzegovina where it was
      a means of ethnic cleansing, to Peru, Rwanda, Bangladesh, Cambodia,
      Cyprus, Haiti, Liberia, Somalia, Uganda and by India in Kashmir. Sexual
      violation of women has been identified by psychologists and the UN “as the
      most intrusive of traumatic events, it erodes the fabric of a community in
      a way that few weapons can”.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  <p>
    In all these ways, the state legitimises, normalises and even promotes
    sexual violence as a means of domination and control. In less overt ways
    than the actual use of sexual violence, governments give the nod to such
    practices in other more covert, coded ways. For instance, the dismissive
    shrugs of immigration ministers when sexual abuse of asylum seekers is
    reported under what is clearly an horrendous regime in the detention centre
    on Nauru; governments’ loyal promotion of churches which are guilty of
    harbouring sexual predators; governments which on the one hand are known for
    their law and order injustices and punitive attitudes towards the poor and
    oppressed, and on the other fail to act against sexual abuse in the ranks of
    their armed forces; the fact that they undermine services which offer
    support for victims of sexual abuse. All these and more signal that sexual
    abuse is not really regarded as a crime – unless it is committed by members
    of an oppressed group such as Muslims or Aborigines – in spite of rhetoric
    about opposing family violence.
  </p>
  <h2>Sexual abuse and the oppressed</h2>
  <p>
    In the context of state-sanctioned use of sexual abuse and the deliberate
    cover-ups by religious institutions and defence by the respectable classes
    of those implicated, the sexual abuse of oppressed groups is neither an
    aberration, nor the acts of irrational individuals. The underlying social
    and economic structures are backed up by ideologies which justify oppression
    and create divisions in the working class, thereby fuelling attitudes which
    lead to sexual abuse.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rape as a means of denigration, control and victimisation has always been a
    terrible consequence of racism. Racially oppressed groups are more likely
    both to experience rape and to be wrongfully accused of it in order to
    maintain a racist order. Angela Davis explained how integral it was to the
    dynamics of racist oppression in her book <em>Women, Race and Class</em>: “a
    weapon of domination, a weapon of repression, whose covert goal was to
    extinguish slave women’s will to resist and, in the process, to demoralise
    their men”.

    A more recent book by Danielle McGuire shows the hypocrisy of white racists
    who regularly lynched black men in the South in the name of protecting
    “their” white women while systematically sexually abusing black women. It
    bears the illuminating title <em>At the Dark End of the Street</em>. In
    Moree, in western NSW, it was on the dark river banks. The freedom rides of
    1965 to towns in western NSW exposed the same racist hypocrisy. Similar
    processes are common in accounts of the pastoral industry such as Sally
    Morgan’s <em>My Place</em>. As Amy McQuire argues, a moral panic whipped up
    by white liberals about male sexual abuse of women and children (later
    proven to be unfounded by the Australian Crime Commission)<span

    On a somewhat different note, the obsessive coverage of a series of gang
    rapes by Lebanese men in Sydney in 2000 was used as a vehicle for the racist
    Carr Labor government to stoke anti-Lebanese and anti-Muslim feeling in NSW.
    Right wing columnist Miranda Devine characterised the rapes as hate crimes
    against white people.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Anyone who knew about the stolen generations knew that stolen Aboriginal
    girls were often sent to middle class homes where they were abused. Now we
    know they and the boys were also abused in the church institutions
    themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    The racist narrative of threatening black men’s uncontrollable sexual urges
    and the fears stoked about stranger danger have an underlying, if perverted,
    affinity with the stereotype of masculinity promoted by schools, the media
    and both popular and highbrow culture. Internalised homophobia can lead men
    who experience same sex attraction to rape men as a way to simultaneously
    act on their desire and reassert an aggressive or “normal” masculinity. In
    this alienated way, the rapist demonstrates that he is “normal”. Some male
    rape may be calculated to humiliate, reducing a man to the status of a
    woman. As Segal put it, “the notion that to affirm manhood is to ‘penetrate’
    another’s body, or to seek ‘active’ sexual pleasure and control over them,
    by whatever means”<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title="" class="reference-body-link"

    is embedded in our culture. Whether it’s a priest with authority over
    vulnerable children, a teacher with desires for young people, a screw with
    little constraint on his denigration of prisoners, sexual abuse by men is
    entwined with the masculinity to which boys are taught to aspire. So
    understanding the integral role of the sexual stereotypes of male and female
    to the culture of capitalism, along with the racism and homophobia that
    intersect with them, is important in understanding many of the various forms
    sexual abuse takes.
  </p>
  <p>
    These stereotypes are rooted in the family, a key institution which
    underpins the capitalist system. It provides a cheap means of reproducing
    the working class, socialised to accept hierarchies of power and authority,
    fit to sell their labour power, the most important commodity in the
    system.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >85</a
      ></span
    >
    In that sense, the family has quite a lot in common with the bureaucracies
    and other institutions discussed above. It is wracked by contradictions and
    distorted by alienation like any other social institution. The control over
    children encourages authoritarian attitudes in parents; children are meant
    to submit to the structure of authority whether they respect the adults or
    not. Relationships in the family, which are assumed to be loving and under
    our control, and the expectations of this private world are more often than
    not ripped apart by the impact of the realities of life, creating tensions
    which create the conditions for abuse. This is especially so among workers
    and the poor and oppressed who have few options to change their position in
    that wider reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    In heterosexual personal relationships, we are not dealing with a situation
    of explicit material power <em>over</em> the other in a country like
    Australia where women have basic rights. But women enter the relationship on
    an unequal footing with men, and not just because of sexist assumptions. The
    gender stereotypes are backed up by the structures of work and the
    family<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >86</a
      ></span
    >
    and so women live with sexual harassment, from leering, suggestive remarks
    to touching, stalking, unwanted sexual advances to outright sexual abuse in
    all areas from the workplace to the family.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stereotypes generated by the family serve to make LGBTI sexuality at
    best something to be “tolerated”, or ignored, both of which promote the
    assumption it is somehow “abnormal”. More often it is denigrated, outlawed
    by religious dictum or rules which forbid same-sex partners at school social
    events. A Human Rights Commission investigation in 2015 revealed that over
    70 percent of LGBTI people interviewed said they had experienced violence,
    harassment or bullying on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender
    identity or intersex status. Over 90 percent said they knew someone who
    had.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >87</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    However, fundamental as they are, the family and the way sexuality is viewed
    and experienced have been able to be restructured to suit the needs of the
    ageing system. As the more far-sighted sociologists and commentators argued
    after the impact of the women’s movement, the sure way to shore up the
    family was to broaden its definition. Single parents, gay couples – it
    matters little in the process of reproducing labour power as long as it is
    privatised and mostly free for the capitalist class and the state.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >88</a
      ></span
    >
    The system, in spite of continuing repressive attitudes to sex, has been
    able to incorporate the hope of women’s and sexual liberation of the 1970s,
    with superficial changes which are a tragic caricature of those dreams. And
    in spite of the changes, the <em>ideal</em> is still based on the old
    stereotypes; just witness the arguments against LGBTI marriage rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stereotypes about women have also changed. Fifty years ago women lived
    with the burden of the wowserist stereotype of housewife and mother; rape in
    marriage was not considered a crime. Even the most serious study of the
    question available in 1992 showed that women found it difficult to name
    their experience of unwanted sex with husbands as “rape”.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >89</a

    >
    Now we live in a society saturated with semi-pornographic images of women
    objectified in a myriad of ways. Pornography is no longer sold under the
    counter. Depicting everything from straight sex to paedophilia, it’s
    available online for anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sexual “freedom” under capitalism has meant a multi-billion dollar sex
    industry. Young people grow up with these porn images as their most common
    way to learn about sex. Because while society talks about it all the time,
    and popular culture openly deals with it, inevitably in sexist and demeaning
    ways, there is still very little sex education or open discussion of
    sexuality in schools. In this era of raunch culture, the increased
    commodification of sex, more explicit than in the 1950s, still emphasises
    women as mere sex objects. Women rarely have sex with a man in movies where
    their own desires are explicit and central. Women are consistently portrayed
    as enjoying, not <em>sex</em> as such, but finding satisfaction in
    fulfilling a man’s needs, revelling in subordinating themselves for men’s
    pleasure. A British Marxist even noted
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      the ghastly irony that two recent books on new feminism (<em
        >Full Frontal Feminism</em
      >
      and <em>The New Sexism</em>) have naked women’s torsos on their front
      covers. The authors may have had little or no control over the cover
      design but it shows that even when publishing a critique of the
      commodification of women’s bodies somebody somewhere deems it necessary to
      do precisely that in order to sell the books.<span

    Feminists Deborah Tolman and Anastasia Powell<span class="floating-ref-link"

    confirm very clearly, with their studies of young people’s relationships,
    what Russell found in her survey of married women and what I argued in 1992:
    what is actually rape is often taken to be seduction. Even when men admit
    they coerced a woman into sex, many seem to genuinely believe it isn’t rape.
    In the words of Powell:
  </p>
  <p>
    (P)orn-chic has been re-cast as <em>the</em> liberated and empowered
    sexuality for young women…
  </p>
  <p>
    Young women are encouraged, even expected, to display an active and “out
    there” sexuality through their behaviour and dress, yet continue to tread an
    impossibly fine line between being judged as a slut if they go too far or
    frigid if they do not embrace their “new-found sexual freedom”.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >92</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Both Powell and Tolman found that young women feel that if they don’t
    succeed in holding a relationship together, they have somehow “failed”. This
    blurs the distinction, even in their own minds, between pressure, coercion
    and rape because they instinctively feel that if they don’t do what
    <em>he</em> likes, he might walk away. This is not confined to young people
    or heterosexuals. At all ages we yearn for a stable, loving relationship, a
    haven in a heartless world. And if we don’t find it, many have a sense that
    they have failed somehow. The romance of St Valentine’s Day, the image of
    the smiling heterosexual couple, also impacts on same-sex couples, which
    goes a long way to explaining the levels of abuse being reported among them.
    Powell also argues:
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post-feminist context it has become difficult to be openly critical
    of sexual mores (even those regarding consent and sexual violence) without
    being labelled anti-choice, anti-sex and seen as rejecting the very sexual
    freedoms that feminism fought to achieve.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >93</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    But it’s not just the gender stereotypes and the felt need for a stable
    relationship. There’s the drudgery of work, long hours, low pay, the
    humiliations meted out by managers, the sense of having no control over your
    life, perhaps an unexpected sacking, pay cut or speed-up. On the other hand,
    there’s the expectation that personal relationships are the one area of our
    lives where we have control. However it’s mostly illusion. The chocolate box
    image, the dream of stability and (usually heterosexual) love is extremely
    difficult for most couples to realise given the reality of the rest of their
    lives. This makes all relationships potentially dangerous hot-houses of
    thwarted hope. Where does someone vent the frustrations and anger generated
    by society at large? On loved ones who they sense will not or cannot walk
    away. People will put up with a lot in order to preserve the hope of
    fulfilling that dream. Any economic insecurity or vulnerability – such as
    being in the closet at work or being transgender, suffering a disability or
    sickness, the lack of housing, the lack of access to social security – all
    make it that much more difficult to assert one’s autonomy. On the other
    hand, a partner might undermine the sense of stability in this one area of
    life by finding another relationship, leading to frantic attempts to assert
    control, and ultimately to stalking and other controlling behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so for many different reasons, subtle control in a relationship can
    cross the often blurred line to become coercion and even outright brutality.
    Abuse in all its forms can pervade relationships in a cycle of domination
    and submission which can be very difficult to break, both because of learned
    roles and the limited options imposed by the realities of work, unemployment
    and lack of access to basic necessities. And as Lillian Rubin suggested, it
    is much more dangerous to take out frustrations and lash out at others in
    public spaces than in the privacy of the home or a relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take children – they have no right to autonomy, they are virtually the
    possessions of their parents with no right to any say over their lives. If
    the state deems those parents unreliable they can be taken, without their
    consent, into what is paradoxically called “care” – institutions in which
    abuse is endemic. In the family, the site of all the tensions I’ve outlined,
    children are the least able to assert their rights or independence against
    not just fathers, but also mothers. Why would adults not abuse children in
    the family? They “belong” to their parents, parents are expected to produce
    children to be proud of and who don’t get in adults’ way. The combination of
    control, expectations and someone weaker on whom to vent frustration makes
    abuse a strong possibility. A 2015 report by the Australian Institute of
    Criminology found that of 1,088 cases where someone was killed by a family
    member, 21 percent were children, with more mothers the killers than
    fathers.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >94</a
      ></span
    >
    The fact that children have no right to autonomy, plus their inexperience
    and differences in strength, makes them extremely vulnerable in home and
    public institutions alike. Philistine attitudes to sex, fear of children’s
    sexuality and the obsession with maintaining a veneer of respectability
    ensure that if they do report abuse they have little chance of being
    believed, and even less of action to remove them from danger.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or think of the elderly, increasingly herded into “retirement villages” or
    eking out an existence in nursing homes. They are not defined by their
    <em>rights</em> but purely by their physical needs; they usually have no say
    over their treatment and are often bullied into taking mind-altering drugs
    to make them docile. Outside these institutions they experience poverty,
    discrimination, lack of resources designed to support their needs and so on,
    making them the subjects of abuse in their families.
  </p>
  <p>
    The oppressed are sitting targets for alienated behaviour by those in charge
    of them or with a status which in the eyes of society justifies – or at
    least tacitly endorses – controlling, domineering attitudes. Men towards
    women; parents, teachers and other authority figures towards children;
    priests to their parishioners and so on. This dynamic is strengthened when
    institutions are understaffed, workers are badly trained, usually low paid
    and with little union organisation to counteract the fragmented, alienated
    existence of work under capitalism.
  </p>
  <p>
    In turn, institutions which limit freedom impact the humanity of those
    incarcerated in them. For example David Heilpern concluded from his research
    into sexual assault in Australian male prisons that:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Sexual assault in prison is not about sex, sexual frustration or latent
      homosexuality – it is about power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rigid hierarchical stratifications develop within the closed environment
      of a prison, and the penis is a weapon of control, ownership and
      domination. It leaves no visible bruises or scars; and shame, fear and a
      culture of silence mean that it is easily hidden from or denied by
      authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      (It) is an inevitable result of the systemic and deliberate disempowerment
      of men in a closed, hierarchical world where state force quashes freedom
      as a means of punishment.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95" title="" class="reference-body-link"

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    While most sexual abuse is committed by men, women, in particular
    circumstances, abuse other women, men and children. The roots of this
    behaviour are nurtured by the same social and economic conditions: commodity
    production, alienation, commodification of sexuality and objectified bodies.
    Women in positions of control over the vulnerable in institutions are
    subject to the same dehumanisation as men. Men are regarded as of higher
    status. Women are not socialised to assume their own entitlement, the right
    to dominate others, but in this reified situation, they attain a status over
    others. Add to this the normalisation of sexual abuse, the dynamic of
    sexuality surrounded by secrecy, the pressures to keep authoritarian control
    and women can become sexual abusers. In the family, the contradiction
    between the ideology of the family as a haven from the public world and the
    reality of life under capitalism, women can and do take out their
    frustrations on children, lacking autonomy as they do, or even lash out at
    their partners. The gender stereotypes ensure a large proportion of sexual
    abuse is inflicted on women by men. But it is far from the only form of
    abuse. Not all men are as domineering, self-confident and aggressive as the
    stereotype says they should be. Not all women are weak, passive and
    nurturing. To assert otherwise would be to assume individuals are completely
    controlled by ideology, which they clearly are not.
  </p>
  <h2>What is to be done?</h2>
  <p>
    With the media regularly promoting campaigns against domestic violence and
    the multiple enquiries into abuse of children and others in care, it is
    imperative that socialists do not just fall in behind populist ideas of what
    to do. Virtually every government response to demands for action on sexual
    violence fuels a law and order agenda. Typically, the Victorian Labor
    government’s submission to the royal commission into family violence it set
    up in 2015 recommends only punitive measures such as a new charge relating
    specifically to domestic violence offenders. The Coalition opposition
    predictably also submitted proposals for mandatory minimum sentences. What
    either proposal would do to lessen the levels of violence is not explained.
    Neither submission mentioned funds for ensuring there is accommodation for
    anyone trying to leave a violent situation or a decent allowance to sustain
    them.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >96</a

    >
    More CCTV in public spaces, restricted bail rights, longer sentences,
    harsher prison regimes, an end to suspended sentences – these are the
    “solutions” pushed by police, the media, politicians and most campaigners.
    But they do nothing to reduce sexual violence. Apart from the fact that jail
    only happens after the event, study after study has shown they do not deter
    offenders, and that more time in prison merely produces more violent
    individuals. The result of such measures is only to diminish the civil
    rights of everyone at a time when human and civil rights are under attack on
    all fronts. In Victoria, as a direct result of demands by campaigners after
    the rape and murder of Jill Meagher in an inner suburb of Melbourne in
    September 2012, suspended sentences were abolished in all courts. As the
    chief executive of Jesuit Social Services, Julie Edwards, said, “The removal
    of suspended sentences as an option for less dangerous crimes will not
    deliver safer communities.”<span class="floating-ref-link"

    There is a growing body of work by criminologists and feminists, especially
    in the US where the consequences of such campaigns became clear years ago,
    that shows the problematic nature of political movements which focus on
    violence against women. There have always been feminists who argued this
    emphasis undermines women’s confidence, promoting the image of us as eternal
    victims.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    It is important to confront the issue not just of demands but of campaigns
    which <em>in themselves</em> give life to any kind of law and order agenda
    in the context of neoliberalism and the growth of the punitive state
    apparatus. Anti-sexist criminologists such as Kristin Bumiller, Dianne L.
    Martin and Aya Gruber have all written extensively on this subject.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2009, Gruber identified the problem this way: “(over) the past several
    years, feminism has become increasingly identified with crime control and
    the prosecution of men who commit offenses against women”. Some feminist
    scholars had begun to express grave concern about being associated with “a
    punitive, retribution-driven agenda”. She concluded that feminists should
    “disentangle” their stand against sexual coercion “from a criminal justice
    system currently reflective of hierarchy and unable to produce social
    justice”.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    Kristin Bumiller, in her book
    <em
      >In an abusive state: How neo-liberalism appropriated the feminist
      movement against sexual violence</em
    >, described the aim of the book as being to formulate
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      an understanding of the contemporary political environment which
      produced…the increasingly coercive state reactions to crimes including
      sexual violence… (I)n the early 1970s… (there was) a phenomenal growth in
      the crime control apparatus including increased prosecutorial power,
      mandatory sentences, and an unprecedented rise in prison populations. At
      the same time, sexual violence became important to the agenda of the
      “therapeutic state”, a network of professionals, social workers, and
      government agents providing service delivery to the poor and
      disadvantaged. These clients of the welfare state are predominantly women
      and their children… As a result, the feminist movement became a partner in
      the unforeseen growth of a criminalized society, a phenomenon with
      negative consequences not only for minority and immigrant groups of men,
      but also for those women who are subject to scrutiny within the welfare
      state.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    She shows that it is not only through tougher sentencing and higher
    incarceration rates that the state is strengthened, but also through
    measures generally considered to be left alternatives to this – more
    domestic violence shelters, victim services and rape crisis centres. She
    argues that this has become another way in which both women and men are
    drawn into the criminal justice system and their rights undermined. Women
    who go into shelters are increasingly expected to take legal action against
    the perpetrator of abuse. Refuges increasingly refuse to take anyone who
    won’t prosecute because they get no government funding for those who don’t.
  </p>
  <p>
    This enmeshes women in dealing with partners even if they just want to get
    away from them. Similar trends are taking off in Australia. This began in
    the 1980s under the influence of feminists whose orientation was retribution
    against men. The parenting allowance became tied to the woman’s efforts to
    force an ex-partner to pay maintenance rather than a right in itself. “Men
    should pay” was the sentiment, but it entraps women, limiting their ability
    to get the full allowance without potentially stressful contact with an
    ex-partner. Today things are becoming much worse. Rates of dual arrest (both
    women and their male partners being arrested by police during instances of
    domestic violence) are increasing in Australia as a result of mandatory
    arrest policies and a greater emphasis on state intervention to resolve
    domestic conflict. Frequently, this can result in further unrelated charges
    for women (for drug possession, unpaid fines etc.), which in turn can
    generate problems with custody of children and even incarceration in some
    cases. It is self-evident that this is a serious problem for Aboriginal
    women who dread deaths in custody and already have much higher rates of
    contact with the injustice system than their non-Indigenous counterparts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The incorporation of service provision into the state apparatus (often on
    pain of funding cuts) is another means by which women as well as men can end
    up being victimised by state measures to combat sexual violence. Recent laws
    passed in NSW now give police the right to access information about women
    who are recipients of support services and their male partners’ whereabouts,
    drug habits and other personal information, without the consent of the women
    or men concerned. Such encroachments on people’s rights, justified by
    appealing to concern about sexual violence, do not address the cause of such
    violence. Instead they serve primarily to give the state more rights to
    intervene in negative ways in people’s lives. It also highlights that there
    are virtually no unproblematic demands that can be raised that directly
    address or work to prevent violence against women. As Bumiller goes on to
    describe the experience in the United States:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The feminist alliance with the state is to a large extent unavoidable.
      Concerning violent crimes against women, it is difficult to imagine
      policies that would not ultimately rely upon the carceral capacities of
      the state. Clearly, there are some instances of grave harm that require
      the segregation of offenders for the protection of society. Yet in the
      United States and other national contexts, it is important to be aware of
      both the potentialities and limitations of using state power to advance
      the interests of women. The growth of neo-liberal politics has provided
      even more reason for skepticism as feminists find their innovations
      incorporated into the regulatory and criminal justice apparatus.<span

  <p>
    One of the conclusions she comes to is that “it no longer makes sense to
    single out violence against women as a specific issue for policy making
    because there are advantages to seeing it as part of a larger project of
    enabling women to be more effectual citizens”.<span

    In other words, fighting women’s structural oppression is the most effective
    means to combat sexual violence.

    The moral panic created around the murder of Jill Meagher in 2012 provoked
    sharp debates about whether the left should get behind street marches led by
    police chiefs, the Liberal Premier and the Mayor of Melbourne, Robert Doyle,
    the former leader of the state Liberal Party, amidst calls for increased law
    and order measures. Doyle had just weeks before ordered the violent removal
    of the Occupy Melbourne protest from the City Square. He stood to improve
    his image with small-l liberals somewhat by leaping on this band wagon which
    tapped into horror of such sexual violence. As Viktoria Ivanova found
    eighteen months later, this campaign had exactly the outcome those opposed
    to participating predicted and is clearly seen in this way:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In Victoria, sweeping law and order “reforms” have resulted in the
      prisoner population increasing 14 percent over the last year – that’s the
      highest increase in the country. “The Victorian government’s change in
      policy”, wrote ABC journalist Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop in July, “can be
      traced back to the public outcry over the brutal murder of Jill Meagher in
      2012, which sparked a tightening of parole, sentencing and bail
      laws”.<span class="floating-ref-link"

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Louise O’Shea made this point at the time: “Moral panics about crime or
    violence between individuals, in particular the need to protect white women
    and children from harm, are almost always used by governments to promote
    reactionary ideas and to justify attacks on people’s rights.”<span

    Her point, unfortunately, has been vindicated. Ironically, but tragically,
    women – particularly Aboriginal women – are now the fastest growing group of
    prisoners in Australia. But at the time her position was met with howls of
    outrage by many on the left. Some argued that the left should be part of
    such events in order to influence their outcome. But it flies in the face of
    reality to think that the left, tiny as it is and lacking authority in any
    broader layer in society, could possibly influence any project driven by
    middle and ruling class figures. Even if the left had mass roots, to
    influence – or more to the point, <em>defeat – </em>any program pushed by
    the state and respectable society, would take an enormous mobilisation, not
    as participants, but as <em>opponents. </em>To a lesser extent, many on the
    left were disoriented by the Cronulla riot of 2005 in the face of Labor
    premier Bob Carr’s invocation of the racist trope of Lebanese men
    threatening the purity of “white” women. Many who participated in an
    anti-racist rally a week later, insisted we had to acknowledge the sexism of
    Lebanese men rather than simply make a clear statement of opposition to the
    racism which had led to the riots.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no easy solutions, but socialists have to start from reality and
    what has the possibility of a progressive outcome, not fall in behind
    cynical campaigns by those in positions of authority who are responsible for
    the conditions which breed sexual violence. Feelings of atomisation, the
    notion that we are all just individuals subject to forces beyond our control
    is one of the key buttresses of capitalism and a sentiment that demobilises
    the working class. This atomisation pushes workers to cast around for a
    force that can offer some protection against individual threats. Because
    there is currently no organised mass working class force that can
    realistically prevent anti-social behaviour, concern about violence leads
    virtually inevitably to greater identification with authority. Johanna
    Brenner, a socialist feminist, comments that as confidence in the movement’s
    ability to win reforms wanes, “reliance on the coercive arm of the state” by
    feminists in the US has increased.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >105</a
      ></span
    >
    The state is after all the force in society best equipped to control the
    behaviour of individuals. It devotes much time and effort to this end – much
    of it in the guise of “protecting” the weak.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bigger jails and more repressive laws do nothing to rebuild working class
    self-confidence and traditions of solidarity – things which do push back
    against the alienation at the heart of the problem. With a stronger working
    class movement, able and willing to fight for better conditions for staff
    which give them a sense of dignity and self-worth, for programs which aim to
    heighten awareness and minimise prejudices backed up by a less bigoted
    atmosphere generally, it is conceivable that even under capitalism, abuse
    could be minimised both in personal life and in public institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are concrete things to campaign for which can contribute to that
    rebuilding. These include fighting budget cuts by both Liberal and Labor
    governments which erode working class living standards and increase tensions
    in personal relationships; and in particular, campaigning for decent,
    affordable housing, to raise the dole, to make the supporting parent’s
    payment available until children are older and de-linked from maintenance
    from ex-partners, for child care to be affordable and accessible. Also
    important are campaigns like that for equal marriage rights, support for
    students who campaign against homophobia and transphobia in schools,
    standing up for children’s right to have a say over their lives and things
    like access to social security when they need to leave a violent household,
    anything which provides young people with images of women and men that don’t
    rely on the sexist stereotypes, campaigns for equal pay. In the unions we
    need to demand they have officers who can attend a workplace to deal with
    accusations of sexual harassment in an appropriately collective way, rather
    than give employers an excuse to intervene.
  </p>
  <p>
    These are all things which could actually give anyone, children, women and
    men, some ability to live independent lives, to leave abusive partners or
    parents, to find the confidence to expose abusers in institutions and
    bureaucracies. There is much to fight for which does not involve
    strengthening the repressive aspects of the state. They are the kinds of
    struggles which can unite workers on a class basis, which raise the need for
    stronger unions and more responsive trade union officials. Not all of these
    will yield immediate results or necessarily have sexual violence as their
    main focus. But the connections between the ways in which the system denies
    control to the mass of people over their lives, work and sexuality, and how
    it fosters the conditions that enable and encourage sexual violence, make
    such an approach necessary. It is the only way to weaken the social roots of
    sexual violence.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    As Helen Razer says in the book
    <em>Fury: Women write about Sex, Power and Violence</em>, a lot of the
    discussions about sexual violence are focused on the experiences of
    individuals, emphasising that a sexist society produces violence against
    women. This can mean that
  </p>
  <p>
    we ignore the possibility that our social structures beget violence at a
    level even more fundamental than that of gender difference…
  </p>
  <p>
    Labour, surveillance, psychiatry, environmental degradation and other
    institutions claim us physically and emotionally.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >106</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly, sexual abuse, from inappropriate touching to pressure, coercion or
    rape, is a traumatising and widespread experience in this society. The
    causes are multiple and complex and can only be understood as rooted in the
    economic and social structures of capitalism, a class society which has
    taken alienation to its extremes. The commodification of sex and the
    objectification of our bodies, the sexist stereotypes and the ideal of
    aggressive masculinity create an environment conducive to abuse. If sex is
    up for sale, why not use bodies, which are no more than objects, for your
    own gratification? Why not follow any sadistic desires when there are others
    with less status, or under your control? After all the state actually uses
    sexual violence to impose its authority, to terrorise individuals or
    communities, and actively encourages its representatives to dream up
    innovative new ways to humiliate and degrade people. The indifference of
    respectable institutions which prioritise the smooth order of the system
    over individual rights normalises sexual abuse as a means of asserting and
    maintaining authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sexual violence can be a conscious employment of terror or the will to
    subordinate. It can be the result of individuals lashing out because of the
    stressful experience of life in this society. It can be the result of both.
    The oppressed, from women to children or the elderly and LGBTI people, are
    easy targets both because of the dominant ideas which attribute a lesser
    status to them and the material discrimination and disadvantage which limit
    their ability to assert their autonomy. Alienation and the power of the
    state and its bureaucracies turn individuals into cogs in a wheel of
    inhumanity and sterility. This dynamic in the public arena legitimises abuse
    in the most intimate, private aspects of our lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The widespread growth of industries like sex trafficking, which involve
    possibly millions including women and children of both genders, and child
    pornography which involves torture and even death of children as young as a
    few months old cannot be understood as some horrendous aberration. They rise
    from the putrid system of profit-driven capitalism. They flourish in the
    poorest countries where desperate parents sell children and women gamble on
    getting into a richer country. Its products are consumed in the richest
    countries, feeding the profits of men and women organising the sex industry,
    highlighting the absolute depravity and inhumanity capitalism breeds. These
    extremes might seem unconnected to the day to day experience of many
    intimate partners, of people living in need of care or under the control of
    authority figures. But they arise from the same structures and are produced
    by the same society.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Lukács puts it, capitalism “knows no bounds and scorns every human
    dignity”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
