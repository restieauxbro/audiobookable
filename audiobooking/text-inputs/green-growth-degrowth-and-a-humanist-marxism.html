        Marx says that revolutions are the locomotive of world history. But
        perhaps it is quite otherwise. Perhaps revolutions are an attempt by
        passengers on this train – namely, the human race – to activate the
        emergency brake.

      Capitalism is destroying the planet. A climate report released at the end
      of 2023 emphasises that “we are entering an unfamiliar domain regarding
      our climate crisis, a situation no one has ever witnessed firsthand in the
      history of humanity”.<sup

      Responding to the climate crisis and related environmental destruction is
      urgent, but politically contested. At the centre of this lies the key
      question: can the capitalist system be restructured to enable a
      sustainable future, or indeed any future for humanity at all? The climate
      movement is divided on this point. Advocates of green growth assert that
      the system merely needs to be responsibly managed – that with the right
      policies the economy and environment can be balanced. In contrast are
      those who argue that a change in the system of production is needed to
      solve the climate crisis. They understand, albeit to varying degrees, that
      it is the normal functioning of capitalism that results in climate change
      and environmental degradation. Within this anti-capitalist camp, however,
      there is no single coherent program for changing the world. Many have
      taken up degrowth theory, which insists that the economy must be shrunk to
      ensure it remains within environmental limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article will engage with various green growth, degrowth and
      ecosocialist thinkers to try to construct a Marxist approach to these
      issues. Key questions relating to the nature of growth will be drawn out,
      as well as an understanding of science, and of labour as a means by which
      humans relate to the natural world. Given that most degrowth theorists
      base their assumptions on the creation of a post-capitalist society,
      issues arise surrounding the animating forces of such a society, such as
      what would drive it and, more fundamentally, how it can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      One question I want to address now is whether Marxists have anything to
      gain from engaging in debates on the nature of post-capitalist societies.
      A common, and not at all incorrect, response from revolutionary socialists
      is to assert that the solution to the climate crisis is a socialist
      revolution. And given the challenges to achieve such a feat, speculating
      about how to organise a post-revolutionary society is futile. However,
      through this article I hope to show that there is a lot to be gained by
      applying the Marxist method and historical approach to contemporary
      environmental debates, including on the nature of a social organisation
      under a speculative communist society. Doing so can shine light on key
      assumptions and conclusions of Marxism. These include the necessary
      distinction between universal and historically contingent human social
      relations, the nature of the forces of production, the ever-evolving
      relationship of human society to nature through changes in labour and
      science, and a Marxist understanding of growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will begin by arguing why green growth is impossible under capitalism.
      Degrowth and its history will then be discussed, before I move on to some
      direct debates between socialist green growth and degrowth advocates and a
      critique of the attempted synthesis of Marxism with degrowth in the works
      of Kohei Saito. I will argue for the fundamental incompatibility of
      degrowth with Marxism, concluding with an analysis of science and labour
      under capitalism, and why a Marxist vision for a communist future is one
      motivated by freedom, not degrowth.

    <h2>Green growth: Why capitalism cannot be sustainable</h2>

      The vast bulk of organisations advocate a “green growth” perspective.<sup

      This includes the OECD, the United Nations Environment Program and World
      Bank, as well as many groups on the broad left. Despite their differences,
      green growth advocates tend to argue that there is nothing fundamentally
      incompatible between economic growth and environmental sustainability.
      Instead, they argue that it is a matter of proper policy and management as
      to whether a sustainable ecology can be maintained. Theoretically, green
      growth depends upon both significant government intervention into the
      economy to invest and regulate as required, but also the market mechanisms
      of capitalism encouraging new sustainable technologies.<sup

      When capital isn’t in the process of circulation or reinvestment it is
      reducing in value due to inflation or the depreciation of machinery.
      Because of these factors, both individual capitalist firms and even the
      total economies of countries must grow at a steady rate in order to be
      healthy. This growth is dependent on the exploitation of both labour power
      and the Earth’s natural resources.<sup

      It is also important to understand that capitalism isn’t just a system of
      private ownership of production, but one defined essentially by the
      relationship of the mass of the population to production.<sup

      Growth is a central feature of capitalism, and our institutions and
      economy are geared towards maximising it. This “growth paradigm” is a
      focus of the degrowth criticism of green growth. Degrowth advocates see
      the growth paradigm, “growth ideology”, or “growth imperative”<sup

      as the major barrier to a sustainable transition. This can take extremely
      idealistic forms, in that it is simply the Western ideology of growth or
      consumerism which must be combatted. On the other hand, some criticism of
      the growth imperative can take a systematic approach and point towards
      growth being essential to capitalism. In this form it is a critique which
      can point to and combat the source of the climate crisis – the global
      system of waged labour, competition, private accumulation and
      exploitation.<sup

      Degrowthers also argue that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – a measure of
      the monetary value of everything a country produces – is a key part of
      growth ideology, as it reduces all the different measures of a society’s
      functioning to a single number which values only the expansion of the
      economy, especially finance and extractive industries.<sup

      Because capitalism cannot exist without expanding and there are limits
      related to planetary materials and pollution, whether or not green growth
      is possible depends upon growth being decoupled from resource use and
      carbon emissions.<sup

      While some wealthy developed countries have achieved or are in the process
      of achieving decoupling of carbon emissions from GDP, this is only
      possible through the export of manufacturing and investment in renewable

      necessary to avoid climate destruction.<sup

      One of the hopes of green growth advocates is that as new technologies
      develop, they will decrease the resource and energy cost of production as
      a whole. However, because of the logic of the capitalist system such hopes
      are ill-fated. The Jevons paradox is the phenomenon whereby increases in
      the efficiency with which a resource is used in production results in no
      change, or even an increase, in the rate at which that resource is
      consumed.<sup

      The Jevons paradox reflects the contradictory functioning of capitalism,

      When some new development makes production more efficient it becomes
      incumbent upon a capitalist firm not just to adopt the development, but
      exploit it to the fullest, buying new machinery, working labourers harder
      and so on. They must do this because of competition; if they do not adopt
      new technology and expand they risk losing market share and going out of
      business. New technologies have always resulted in an increase in
      resources use, in productivity and the destruction of nature.<sup

      The other means by which new technologies are supposed to save capitalism
      from the climate crisis is through some breakthrough development which can
      solve some issue of unsustainable production or global warming. Proposed
      routes for these developments include nuclear energy, expanding recycling
      to encourage a more circular economy, carbon capture and storage, or forms
      of geoengineering. Nuclear energy is no environmentally friendly or
      sustainable solution, requiring immense resources use and producing a
      toxic byproduct.<sup

      And while carbon capture and storage – including sequestering excess
      carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and BECCS (Bioenergy with carbon
      capture and storage) – will probably play some role in a sustainable
      transition,<sup

      the technology is largely unproven. For now, an over-reliance on BECCS in

      action, leaving the problem for future generations to solve.<sup

      This is the basic logic behind most of green growth; do everything to keep
      the system running as normal, pushing action further and further into the
      future when supposed rapid advances in technology, aided by good
      government policy, will solve the crisis.

      Finally, geoengineering, which refers to methods which alter the Earth’s
      energy balance, is the most potentially disastrous. Geoengineering
      includes projects which could increase the reflectivity (albedo) of the
      Earth so that the amount of incoming solar radiation which reaches and
      heats up the surface of the planet is reduced. It includes things like
      whitening clouds or building massive mirrors to put into space or cover
      the surface of the ocean. These methods would mask the damage that carbon
      dioxide emissions are having on the atmosphere by counteracting the impact
      on heating, but they would do nothing for other effects such as ocean
      acidification and would have to be continually scaled up with atmospheric
      carbon dioxide. Even more dangerous is the sending of aerosols into the
      stratosphere to increase its reflectivity, which is also the
      geoengineering method most accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on
      Climate Change (IPCC).<sup

      Stratospheric aerosols don’t just mask the effects of carbon dioxide and
      require constant upkeep to do so, they also could have a slew of other
      impacts on atmospheric chemistry and cloud formation.<sup

      Capitalism, a system driven by competition and prone to crises, cannot be
      trusted to maintain the massive feats of geoengineering which would be
      required to mitigate global warming.

    <p>
      It’s clear that green growth or sustainable development is impossible
      under capitalism, and that therefore, a solution to the climate crisis
      must radically challenge the logic of the system and do more than reform
      it. Degrowth purports to be one such radical challenge.
    </p>
    <h2>Degrowth as an alternative</h2>
    <p>
      As an area of academic development, degrowth is presently in a state of
      flux and evolution, with a few tendencies vying for influence. For the
      purposes of this article, only the more left-wing versions of degrowth
      will be addressed. Jason Hickel is the foremost representative of what can
      be termed socialist-technocratic degrowth. In his highly influential book
      <em>Less is More</em>, Hickel defines degrowth as “a planned downscaling
      of energy and resource use to bring the economy back into balance with the
      living world in a safe, just and equitable way”.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      However, disagreements exist on the source of the growth problem, the
      exact form that degrowth takes, and how it can be achieved. To discuss
      this requires first outlining the history of degrowth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most of its history degrowth existed as an economic perspective
      prevalent only in academic circles. <em>Décroissance </em>(degrowth) was
      first used by the French intellectual André Gorz in a debate with Herbert
      Marcuse and others in 1972 to counter a government conference on economic
      growth.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      From this first mention degrowth was counterposed to capitalist growth,
      questioning whether the system is compatible with a balanced Earth.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      However, despite the term arising in the radical atmosphere after May
      1968, it failed to develop into a coherent critique of capitalism and was
      limited to a counter-position to economic growth.<sup

      It wasn’t until a re-emergence in late 2001 that degrowth took on its
      modern definition with a special issue of the periodical
      <em>L’écologiste </em>(The ecologist) titled
      <em>Défaire le développement, refaire le monde! </em>(Unmake development,
      remake the world).<sup

      It was specifically the work of Serge Latouche which brought degrowth from
      mere economic decline into a more holistic questioning and restructuring
      of society.<sup

      Many of the developments up to that point were then synthesised and
      popularised by Jason Hickel in <em>Less is More</em>, and subsequently
      there has been further attention to degrowth in the works of Kohei Saito,
      which will be discussed later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socialist-technocratic degrowth recognises the need to move beyond
      capitalism, but fails to articulate the form this transition could take
      beyond a set of radical policy measures. But before extrapolating this key
      criticism, there are a few weak arguments against this form of degrowth
      that should be clarified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most popular rejoinder to degrowth proposals is the truism that there
      are places in the world which do not bear significant responsibility for
      the climate crisis, and where a decrease in the scale of the economy would
      result in a large portion of the population not having their needs
      adequately met. However, degrowth asserts that while a net decrease in
      global resource use is required, not every society, nor every individual
      in the most affluent societies, need consume less. Hickel in
      particular<sup
        ><sup

      has placed great emphasis on decolonisation and how degrowth policies
      could allow for historically colonised nations to wipe away predatory debt
      arrangements with, and develop unhindered by, the West.<sup

      And for the developed world, while there would be a net decrease in
      material throughput and energy use, through redistributive measures the
      poorest should see an increase in their standard of living.<sup

      This also addresses a second common challenge – that degrowth is another
      form of austerity that would decrease the living standard of working-class
      people. While empirically this is untrue with regard to the kind of
      degrowth argued for by Hickel, it still stands as a propagandistic barrier
      to degrowth being popularly accepted. Some degrowthers welcome this
      response, as it shows that degrowth is a term which cannot be coopted by
      capitalism, unlike something like “sustainable development” or a “just
      transition”.<sup
        ><sup

      Elsewhere degrowth is talked of less as a propagandist term and through a
      more scientific lens. But most interestingly degrowth is used as a wedge
      to push against the capitalist ideology of growth,<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      and if degrowth is seen as austerity then capitalist ideology still
      maintains too tight a hold for any slogan to really break capitalism in
      the first place. This is part of a broader strategy whereby degrowth,
      along with other appealing anti-capitalist policies, develops into a
      counter-hegemony to neoliberal capitalism, <em>à la</em> a particular
      reading of Italian communist Antonio Gramsci.<sup

      However, under capitalism the reality of degrowth – economic contraction –
      will always be against the basic interests of the working class, which is
      to increase their material standard of living, and so is effectively
      limited as a popular slogan.<sup

      Finally, it’s argued that degrowth does not mean a return to primitive
      forms of technology but would in fact require widespread adoption and
      development of new, truly environmentally friendly techniques and
      machinery.<sup

        ></sup
      >
      While these clarifications make degrowth less disagreeable, it is unclear
      what it adds to a revolutionary socialist strategy beyond an empirical
      argument for decreasing total resource and energy use in the immediate
      transition away from capitalism. This is especially true when considering
      the major proposed methods of application are technocratic and idealist.

      His proposals are based on an understanding that “capitalism is a system

      and that therefore if society were more rationally organised it wouldn’t
      be directed at profit but fulfilling needs. Firstly, he that argues in
      order to rapidly slow down the rate of resource and energy use the global
      economy needs to end planned obsolescence and advertising, shift from
      ownership to usership, end food waste and decrease the size of
      environmentally destructive industries.<sup

      Then addressing the political problems such challenges to the current
      capitalist order would entail, Hickel resorts to explaining how the
      policies would rationally work. He argues that a degrowth transition would
      be accompanied by a jobs guarantee, while also reducing work hours.<sup

      While Hickel recognises that there are forces in society with an interest
      in preventing these reforms, he appeals to an idealised democracy in
      which, because degrowth is in the interests of most people, it will be
      adopted despite the protests of the minority.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      This is what separates Hickel’s perspective from a Marxist one. Hickel and
      other writers from his intellectual milieu see the problems of society as
      technical, and while they agree that there are systemic issues in the way
      society is organised, they believe these can be changed by properly
      outlining a more logical way of running things which benefits most people
      and will for this reason be possible.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

              id="_ednref61"

      He implicitly argues for the possibility that the system could be reformed
      away from its dependence on growth. For Marxists, the illogical
      organisation of production under capitalism is tied to the fact that
      society is not democratic, and that the capitalist class rules in their
      own interest, disregarding damage to the environment, or the will of the
      majority of working-class people. The only way to enact the kind of
      radical and anti-capitalist policies Hickel and other degrowthers advocate
      is through the self-activity of the working class, and a revolution which
      overturns the capitalist relations of production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hickel’s formulation of degrowth is one of the more serious in that it not
      only recognises the scale of change necessary to solve the climate crisis
      but also attempts to deal with the challenges of bringing about this
      change. However, the lack of a Marxist understanding of capitalism and the
      limit to reforms means that it cannot be anything more than a series of
      technocratic solutions to the ecological crisis. So socialist-technocratic
      degrowth does not offer a convincing alternative to capitalist green
      growth, but the empirical argument for the need to degrow generally is
      compelling, and degrowth advocates have not limited their arguments only
      to capitalist green growth.
    </p>
    <h2>Degrowth vs socialist green growth</h2>
    <p>
      This section explores the debate between <em>Jacobin </em>contributor Matt
      Huber, representing a socialist perspective of green growth, and a number
      of degrowth proponents, most notably Giorgos Kallis. Kallis’ critique is
      targeted at socialists who accept capitalism’s deleterious impact on the
      natural world but suppose that if the growth were to happen under
      socialism it would, by some mechanism, be sustainable.<sup

      He also problematises growth as something with a quantitative meaning in a
      post-capitalist society, as a socialist economy would seek to maximise
      use-value, rather than having any measure of exchange value (GDP,
      typically).<sup

          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      A final key intervention is the argument that growth requires accumulation
      through exploitation; that a socialist society wouldn’t accumulate as it
      wouldn’t take surplus value from its workers.<sup

      His 2022 book, <em>Climate Change as Class War</em>, is a polemical work
      largely directed at the middle-class climate movement, and argues for a
      turn away from emphasising climate policies and towards empowering the
      working class as the solution to the climate crisis. He emphasises that
      the dominant discourse wrongly centres individual consumption choices
      rather than capitalism-enforced production, and that what is needed is not
      the utopian solutions of many climate-minded academics, but class war
      which puts power in the hands of the global proletariat.<sup

      While some degrowth advocates attempt to grapple with the political

      Huber responds to these by invoking Friedrich Engels’
      <em>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</em>, arguing against any utility to
      the imaginative futures described in works such as
      <em>Half Earth Socialism </em>by asking rhetorically: “[d]oes this
      utopianism yield a strategy to confront the political and economic power

      Huber confronts the charge that all growth is unsustainable by appealing
      to the creative power of the proletariat, arguing that “solving climate
      change requires new social relations of production that would develop the
      productive forces toward clean production”.<sup

      As for the other arguments Kallis makes of socialism requiring degrowth,
      Huber is consistent in mischaracterising the latter.<sup

      However, Huber makes many useful criticisms of degrowth, powerfully
      demonstrating how degrowth makes a fetish of growth and in doing so
      hypostasises the concrete capitalist class into an abstract system rather
      than a concrete collection of companies, governments, and so on.<sup

      Huber also rightly argues that the decolonial emphasis territorialises
      responsibility for degrowing and hides the decisive class element, so that
      degrowthers see the world primarily in terms of Global North and Global
      South, rather than workers and bosses.<sup

      Despite Huber’s green growth perspective being fundamentally correct –
      that the collective creativity of workers could allow for a sustainable
      development of production – his lack of a clear revolutionary perspective
      means he fails to articulate a method of achieving this. So his advocacy
      of green growth fails to break with the fundamental problems of
      sustainable development under capitalism. He also fails to articulate what
      this growth-based future society could look like.

      it is clear that these debates sorely need a clear revolutionary Marxist
      intervention. To date, the most significant intersection of degrowth
      theory and Marxism came with Kohei Saito.
    </p>
    <h2>Marx and degrowth communism</h2>
    <p>
      Marxist terminology and concepts are present throughout much of the
      degrowth literature, and a Marxist understanding of class was dominant in
      the socialist articulation of green growth, but neither make full use of
      the Marxist tradition in responding to the problem of climate change and
      ecological destruction. For much of the late twentieth and twenty-first
      centuries Marxism was not widely considered conducive to an ecological
      understanding. This was due primarily to hostility to a class analysis
      from ecological thinkers in this period, reinforced by the productivist
      perversion of Marxism prevalent in the Soviet Union and China, and the
      abandonment of a dialectics of nature by the Western Marxist tradition
      after Lukács. In recent years however, there has been a resurgence and
      rediscovery of the Marxist ecological tradition, primarily through the
      works of John Bellamy Foster, in particular his 2000 book
      <em>Marx’s Ecology</em>, along with Paul Burkett’s
      <em>Marx and Nature </em>from 1999.<sup

    <p>
      Saito’s works have drastically changed the terrain of degrowth politics,
      popularising a form of Marxism among advocates of degrowth theory. His
      book <em>Slow Down: How Degrowth Communism Can Save the Earth </em>sold
      over half a million copies within a year of publication in Japan; its most
      theoretical sections were adapted and expanded in the 2023
      <em>Marx in the Anthropocene </em>(hereafter referred to as
      <em>MitA</em>), to immense praise. Jason Hickel stated that the work is “A
      masterpiece… herein lies the secret to post-capitalist transition… it will
      change [socialism and environmentalism] forever”. The attempted synthesis
      of Marxism with a degrowth perspective is the most controversial and
      noteworthy aspect of <em>MitA</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saito wants to establish Marx as a degrowth communist as the basis for
      theorising a future society which can reverse climate change and maintain
      sustainability. He argues that capitalism can no longer be seen as
      progressive as it destroys rather than develops the foundation for
      socialism, and that Marx recognised this late in life and began to
      reformulate his theory. It follows from this that the post-capitalist
      society would much more likely be a return to steady-state communes rather
      than an expansive productive society that has come to dominate the Marxist
      understanding of communism.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Saito, the case for Marx adopting a degrowth perspective
      develops from his study of natural science and primitive human societies
      after the publication of the first volume of <em>Capital </em>in 1867.<sup

          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      On some fronts the argument is waged successfully, with Saito’s deep
      reading of Marx and Engels showing a serious transformation in Marx’s
      conception of history and society from unilinear, productivist and
      Eurocentric in his very early writings to one more thoroughly dialectical,
      ecological and most importantly for Saito, multilinear.<sup

      Productivism, for Saito, broadly characterises how the early Marx saw the
      forces of production developing within an old society, coming into
      contradiction with that society, and driving change towards a new one. But
      Saito sees this understanding as untenable today, as “the acceleration of
      productive forces will sooner or later make most of the planet
      uninhabitable before the collapse of capitalism”,<sup
        ><sup

      and argues that Marx himself “[abandoned] his celebration of the
      increasing forces of production [and] came to recognise that the
      sustainable development of the productive forces is not possible under
      capitalism”.<sup

      Marx’s transcending of a unilinear history is incontrovertible, as in
      <em>MitA</em> Saito develops Marx’s rejection of his earlier position that
      “the country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less
      developed, the image of its own future”,<sup

      Ultimately for Saito’s argument, Eurocentrism, productivism and a
      unilinear history are all inextricably connected, and combine to mean that
      “Marx must have completely parted ways with ‘historical materialism’ as it
      had been traditionally understood”.<sup

      Saito has to invoke an extremely strict and inflexible definition of
      historical materialism in which the relations and mode of production in a

      Thus, when developments in production are destructive – as is seen with
      anthropogenic climate change – and a more developed class society is not
      necessarily more progressive than what came before, historical materialism
      no longer holds. In contradistinction to this crude conception, historical
      materialism must be understood not only in the brief ways which Marx and
      Engels spoke of it,<sup

      but as the method of dialectics applied to history. Understood this way
      historical materialism is not incapable of such recognitions as a
      multilinear history or contradictions in productive development and the
      social relations or ecological damage they engender, but centres such
      discoveries and correctly emphasises them as the driving forces of change

      Saito’s main evidence for Marx abandoning historical materialism is in

      In his unsent correspondence with Russian socialist Vera Zasulich, Marx
      argues that Russia can skip the capitalist phase of development through
      the pre-capitalist commune formations and adopting the advances from the
      West. In his own words from the first draft of the letter:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [T]hanks to the unique combination of circumstances in Russia, the rural
        commune, which is still established on a national scale, may gradually
        shake off its primitive characteristics and directly develop as an
        element of collective production on a national scale. Precisely because
        it is contemporaneous with capitalist production, the rural commune may
        appropriate all its positive achievements without undergoing its
        [terrible] frightful vicissitudes. Russia does not live in isolation
        from the modern world, and nor has it fallen prey, like the East Indies,
        to a conquering foreign power.<sup

      Saito interprets the letter and drafts not only as Marx articulating a new
      means of advancing towards communism, but necessarily because of this a
      new form of communism which supersedes the productivist ideas he held
      previously and can be based on communal peasants instead of the working
      class.<sup

      Rather, what Marx is attempting to do here is to apply historical
      materialism to a very peculiar historical circumstance in which a
      primitive mode of production prevails in a society while not being under
      the control of a more advanced power. Zasulich was directly appealing to
      Marx to answer whether Russian socialists should accept capitalist
      development, with all the exploitation and expropriation of primitive
      accumulation,<sup

      With this reading the conclusion no longer follows that Marx comes to a
      different conception of communism: it is still fundamentally based on
      socialised production and the working class. In addition, it is also clear
      that the development of the forces of production is still required for
      moving beyond capitalism, and that they will be harnessed by the
      collective working class to meet human needs. In fact, Marx’s limited and
      unpublished analysis was proven wrong less than 30 years later in 1905,
      when the working class played the dominant political role despite still
      being a tiny minority. Although it is also true that in those years
      between Marx’s draft letters and the revolution Russia underwent dramatic
      changes in the forces of production and the development of capitalism.

      to the archaic equality of steady-state communes in a higher form. Simply
      put, in <em>MitA </em>Saito shows that Marx developed an appreciation for
      the stability of archaic societies, including the rural communes of
      Russia, but the link from this to adopting a steady-state economy as the

      An additional part of Saito’s project is providing an answer as to why
      Marxism has not been seen as ecological; why the USSR and China have had
      such a devastating environmental record, and why many Marxist
      theoreticians adopt a productivist view in which the goal of socialism is
      to expand humanity’s productive power and that this itself would solve any
      ecological problems. He argues that the USSR and China were always going
      to develop into state capitalist nations because the form their Marxism
      took was one based on increasing material abundance. This is stated
      clearly in <em>Slow Down</em>, along with an incredibly apologetic tone in
      his application of Marxism.<sup

      Saito wants to make use of a particular interpretation of the late Marx,
      while rejecting much of his early writings and that of the tradition after
      him. To do this, Saito invokes a rift between Marx and Engels in which
      Engels’ negative influence on the subsequent socialist movement is to
      blame.<sup

      Saito bases this on Engels’ vision of post-capitalism being one of

      Further, the claim that Marx had a different vision of communism than
      Engels rests on the conclusion that Marx was a degrowth communist. If this
      assertion, lacking any textual evidence, is rejected, all that is left is
      differences in emphasis which do not constitute a break between the two
      thinkers. As for explaining why the nominally Marxist USSR and China have
      poor ecological records, it is because they are simply capitalist states
      beholden to the same logic of accumulation and exploitation of nature and
      the working class. They took this particular form of state capitalism not
      because of a particular form of Marxism as Saito argues, but because the
      basis for working-class democracy was destroyed in Russia.<sup

      adoption of degrowth and heavy emphasis on planning by the likes of
      Bellamy Foster<sup

      to a more theoretical synthesis of the two, rooting it in the supposed
      adoption of degrowth communism by the late Marx. But Saito cannot show any
      direct evidence for Marx as a degrowth communist. Nor does he fully apply
      the total breadth of Marxist theory to questions of degrowth and ecology.
      And in doing so, Saito invalidates the vast majority of Marx and Engels’
      intellectual output, as Matt Huber and Leigh Phillips argue: “All that’s
      left in its ashes are idiosyncratic readings of <em>Capital</em>, some
      sparse notebooks copying disconnected passages from agricultural texts,
      and the letter to Zasulich”.<sup

    <h2>Humanist Marxism</h2>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this article humanist Marxism does not mean any
      particular tendency, but an emphasis on alienation and freedom that is for
      some only associated with the early Marx but is actually present
      throughout his late works. Humanism is the belief in the potential for a
      united human race and the ability for us to work collectively towards
      united interests.<sup

      assert that humanity will always be divided, or that certain forces such
      as an innate sense of competition will preclude collective efforts. But

      This brings into question exactly how labour will change post-capitalism,
      and answering this invokes the topic of universal and historically
      specific human relations. Simply, this distinction refers to whether
      relations in human societies apply to every form of social organisation,
      and are in this case universal, or whether they are limited to a
      particular social formation and are historically specific. The distinction
      permeates any discussion of human essence and the form of future socialist
      or communist societies but is rarely directly addressed. To start with, it
      is clear that through the discussion of the human relationship with nature
      that metabolism is a universal condition of human existence – that is,
      that producing and reproducing social life will occur under every form of
      human social organisation. It also follows then that labour, the means by
      which humans interact with nature, is historically non-specific and
      essential to being human.<sup

      On the other hand, relations such as commodities, capital, exchange value,
      the division between mental and manual labour and many more are products
      of class society and liable to be sublated or abolished in post-capitalist
      societies. The most important historically universal social relation for
      the potential for a degrowth Marxism is that of necessary and “free”
      labour. A lengthy exposition comes late in <em>Capital</em>, Volume III:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [T]he realm of freedom really begins only where labour determined by
        necessity and external expediency ends; it lies by its very nature
        beyond the sphere of material production proper. Just as the savage must
        wrestle with nature to satisfy his needs, to maintain and reproduce his
        life, so must civilized man, and he must do so in all forms of society,
        and under all possible modes of production… Freedom, in this sphere, can
        consist only in this, that socialised man, the associated producers,
        govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way, bringing it
        under their collective control instead of being dominated by it as a
        blind power; accomplishing it with the least expenditure of energy and
        in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human nature. But
        this always remains a realm of necessity. The true realm of freedom, the
        development of human powers as an end in itself, begins beyond it,
        though it can only flourish with this realm of necessity as its basis.
        The reduction of the working day is the basic prerequisite.<sup

      labour; that properly managing this human social metabolism with natural
      metabolism requires rational organisation through socialised work; that
      the “development of human powers” is the goal of human society and an end

      but in doing so he removed the line “accomplishing it with the least
      expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for
      their human nature”. In context, this sentence clearly indicates that the
      realm of necessity must be achieved with as little energy – labour time –
      as possible, so that freedom can be expanded. This a significant example
      of Saito wilfully misreading and misinterpreting Marx’s revolutionary
      humanism to come to his degrowth communist conclusion. However, as useful
      as the Marx quote is to expand some of these ideas surrounding freedom, it
      does not directly refute Saito’s case for a transformation of Marx’s
      thought. What it does do is provide a counterposition to Saito’s
      interpretation of the late Marx, in which he adds nuance and transcends
      some of the crudeness of his earlier productivism but maintains and
      strengthens his notion of freedom.

      In every human society there will be a section of the day which consists
      of <em>necessary</em> labour, that which is directed towards reproducing
      society (food, clothes, waste, the means of subsistence), and a section
      which is <em>free</em>, which could be scientific, artistic, etc. and is
      the true location of our species being. Regardless of the fact that labour

      such a division will still remain and be the primary contradiction by
      which a communist society continues to develop, in that it works to
      decrease time spent on necessary labour and expand the time that is truly
      free. The point that the proletariat works to expand its own freedom is a
      consistent emphasis in Marx, not some abstract goal, but imputed from the

      With a humanist understanding of what motivates the working class, or
      associated producers under communism, Saito’s attempt to synthesise
      Marxism with degrowth can be rejected. This is because unlike Bellamy
      Foster, who adopts degrowth as a mere practical necessity,<sup

      Saito makes a principle out of the potential necessity and develops a
      position in which Marxism envisions a society motivated not by freedom,

      While Saito and Hickel maintain that their visions of degrowth would
      result in decreased labour time, this is a product of ending capitalism
      generally. In <em>MitA</em>, Saito echoes Hickel when making the case that
      his vision of degrowth communism doesn’t limit but fully realises freedom
      through the transcendence of artificial scarcity and people being “free
      from the constant pressure to earn money thanks to the expanding common
      wealth”.<sup

      It is inarguable that relative to capitalism people would have greatly
      expanded individual wealth and freedom by any measure, but their degrowth
      societies would still require more labour than a more traditionally
      understood socialism or communism. For instance, Bellamy Foster accepts
      that labour would have to substitute for fossil fuel-derived energy,<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

      greatly increasing the necessary labour society would need to perform. And
      Saito’s steady-state formulation has no interest in expanding the freedoms
      people could enjoy under communism, whether by investing in production
      towards making necessary labour more “worthy and appropriate for human
      nature” or decreasing the necessary labour required at all.

      The failure of writers mentioned in this article to realise some aspect of
      Marxist theory is because many are not revolutionary Marxists, instead
      being various flavours of Marxian economists, post-Marxist world systems
      theorists, or academics using Marxology to attempt to develop a solution
      to the climate crisis, but missing the theory of international
      working-class revolution which is what really defines Marxism.<sup

      Therefore, attempts to combine Marxism with degrowth typically come with a
      revision of the orthodox Marxist understanding of class, such as Bellamy

      In <em>Slow Down</em>, however, Saito is much clearer in advancing his

      While workers are mentioned, ultimately for Saito it is a disambiguated
      citizenry which is the agent of change. His decentring of the working
      class shows that he is not thoroughly applying Marxism to the climate
      crisis, but rather a narrow sliver, improperly interpreted. In the
      conclusion of <em>Slow Down</em> Saito invokes the idea that only 3.5
      percent of a population is needed for major social change,<sup

      The next step is to discuss the concept of growth and how production can
      be expanded without environmental destruction.
    </p>
    <h2>Growth and the forces of production</h2>
    <p>
      Up until this point growth has basically referred to material throughput,
      and for discussing growth under capitalism this has been sufficient.
      However, the definition is unscientific and circular in how it can
      actually be applied to an understanding of degrowth. For an economy to
      grow sustainably it must be able to decouple resource use from GDP, or the
      scale of the economy must be able to increase without a corresponding
      increase in resources. It therefore follows that an economy can grow only
      when it does not grow. One recourse to this problem is to limit growth to
      a measure effectively of exchange value under capitalism (GDP) and concede
      that no quantitative measure of growth exists post-capitalism in an
      economy directed towards the production of wealth or use value. Such an
      approach effectively gives up on answering the legitimate challenges
      degrowth poses as to the limits and source of growth under communism.
      Against this position, Marxism offers a transhistorical and scientific
      understanding of growth, rooted in the humanism and ecological theories
      discussed in this article. This understanding can then be developed and
      solidified through a Marxist conception of science and its practical
      embodiment in the forces of production,<sup

      made fully realisable through unalienated labour and making possible a
      growth-based communist society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capitalism is not the first society to grow. However, in all
      pre-capitalist societies, class-divided or not, which are driven only by
      meeting the needs of subsistence of the masses and potentially of luxury
      consumption for the ruling class and their armies, growth could not expand
      in the explosive, exponential way it does under the present social system.
      This is due to the fact that the surplus was not systematically reinvested
      into production, and therefore growth of an economy was dependent upon
      growth of the population. Capitalism is different because the surplus is
      put back into production, to increase the productivity of labour through
      investment in constant capital. Through this analysis a number of factors
      in growth can be distinguished: population, labour hours and labour
      productivity. It is clear that if any country grows a greater population,
      has its citizens work more hours, or improves its process such that it is
      more productive, all else remaining the same, it has grown in all three
      instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Marx had a specific and scientific analysis of value under
      capitalism, but at times hinted at the possibility of a transhistorical
      conception of value,<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref166"

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      a transhistorical notion of growth can be grasped based on a function of
      labour hours (which also embodies population size and is itself the locus
      of value) and that labour’s productivity. This is also the essence of the
      forces of production; that they are past labour, and the appropriation of
      natural resources, embodied in some form which increases the productivity
      of future labour. The forces of production are therefore the concrete form
      of one half of the growth equation. In this way growth is not just based
      on labour, but also on nature, in that the way productivity increases is
      through nature being used in the labour process to augment the work
      itself. Growth is therefore intimately linked to natural and social
      metabolisms,<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a

      with all forms of unsustainable growth being predicated on using nature to
      bolster labour productivity beyond the rate at which nature can reproduce
      itself; in producing a metabolic rift. We then return to the problem of
      sustainable growth requiring decoupling from resource use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every form of human social organisation has had some limit to its growth,
      often framed historically as a maximum population or holding capacity.
      Throughout history each of these has been surpassed due to advances in
      class society, the corresponding forces of production, and a greater
      understanding of science or humans’ relationship with nature. The limits
      to growth under capitalism are the same as previous limits in that they
      are not absolute, but relative and dialectical. While the sustainable
      level of atmospheric carbon dioxide does present itself as a breakpoint
      beyond which the Earth’s natural metabolism would be disrupted, or that
      there is a limit to the land which can be transformed for human use, these
      are not limits to growth universally, but in particular.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      Under capitalism, with its metabolic rift and competitive drive precluding
      serious counteraction, these limits can and certainly will prevent further
      growth. What is unique about capitalism is that its scale of production
      pushing up against these limits is threatening more than just stagnating
      growth, but utter collapse. However, if society were reorganised around
      collective ownership, the associated producers could realise the
      relativity of these limits, growing through other means. Where practical
      they could actively counteract the damage done by capitalism to the
      planet. These limits include those associated with being confined to
      planet Earth. Key to the conception of the malleability of limits to
      growth is expanding the forces of production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expanding here cannot just be quantitative, but qualitative. Contrary to
      the crude understanding of Marx’s historical materialism, in which each
      form of class society is surpassed when it becomes a fetter on the scale
      of production, the humanist reading of Marx makes it clear that the sense
      in which capitalism is a fetter on production is through the alienation of
      the labourer; separating humans from the product of their labour and their
      species being. This is also the way that Marx advanced upon basic
      productivism in which the “domination over nature to achieve an abundance
      of wealth”<sup

      Saito would say that this is an example of Marx’s early productivism, but
      interpreted through a humanist lens and in a broader context, Marx and
      Engels’ argument here is primarily about meeting our species being through
      the expansion of production. Society’s problems will be solved by
      mobilising our collective creative power through productive labour. Marx’s
      early writings can fall into productivism because the expansion of
      productive powers appears as both the teleological goal of society and
      therefore the measure by which one society is more progressive or advanced
      than another, making it possible to read him as approving colonialism in
      some instances. However, it is clear that the late Marx recognises the
      contradictory nature of capitalist development and values productivity
      only insofar it is a necessary component to expanding human freedom;
      humanism – but only when free of the limitations of capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Degrowth also rests on an assumption that human needs are finite,<sup

      but Marx argued that after meeting human necessity, the goal of human
      society is to continue to expand the realm of freedom indefinitely. As for
      Kallis’ argument that growth would require exploitation,<sup

      this fails to appreciate how a socialist or communist society would be
      fundamentally different from capitalism, as people would freely contribute
      their surplus labour towards increasing the common wealth after labour has
      become life’s prime want – there would be no motivation nor possibility
      for exploitation without private ownership and appropriation. Capitalism
      has exploitation and surplus value or profit, communism has free time or
      surplus labour which would be willingly “reinvested” towards bettering
      society.

      Finally, Saito makes a compelling case that the forces of production

      Apart from using this as evidence of Marx abandoning historical
      materialism, he further argues that capitalism does not prepare the
      conditions for a sustainable economy. This misinterpretation stems from
      the same place as his interpretation of Marx’s letters to Zasulich: a lack
      of appreciation of the working class as the force which can reappropriate
      the forces of production towards useful ends.<sup

      Certainly the forces of production embodied in the creation of tanks and
      missiles would have no place; but factories can be retooled, products
      recycled, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, there is a factory in Melbourne which is involved in the
      production of F-35 fighter jets; but while these end products would never
      exist in a rational society, the heat-treatment that goes into their
      production could potentially find new and expanded civilian use.
      Capitalism makes it appear that the productive forces only develop for the
      benefit of capital, but this is a mystification of what is in actuality
      the embodiment of human powers,<sup

      The final step to elucidating this possibility is a discussion of science,
      and how it can be radically transformed only after moving beyond class
      society.
    </p>
    <h2>Science: under capitalism and beyond</h2>
    <p>
      The possibility of growth and the expansion of the forces of production
      without ecological destruction depends upon understanding the nature of
      science and how it can be radically transformed in a future society. Our
      ability to interact with nature must be understood at a qualitatively
      different level such that productivity or population can expand without
      either an increase in resource use or while expanding the resource pool.
      So, while it is clear that under capitalism resources are primarily
      allocated in search of expanding profits, regardless of environmental
      cost, it is not enough to say that by reversing this under a communist
      society continued growth is therefore possible. The intellectual products
      of a society do not happen at random or due to the unique genius of
      particular individuals but are themselves products of the economic
      relations of the society the ideas develop out of. Marx famously argued
      that: “The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling
      ideas”,<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"
            ><a
              id="_ednref181"

            ></span
          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      but the ways in which class society determines the possibility of ideas
      goes far beyond just the ruling ideas. The British Marxist Christopher
      Caudwell explored the effects of bourgeois society on culture, literature
      and science.<sup
        ><sup
          ><span class="floating-ref-link"

          ></sup
        ></sup
      >
      In his incomplete work <em>The Crisis in Physics</em>, Caudwell showed the
      limits of a bourgeois mechanical conception of natural science and how a
      dialectical method is necessary to develop beyond roadblocks around
      problems such as those of determinacy,<sup

      There are near limitless ways to describe how a capitalist organisation of
      science and society results in innovation being limited, and many
      practically stem from capitalist class relations generally. As much as an
      individual scientist can be seen to have more freedom in their labour than
      a typical worker, they are still subject to the same forces of capital
      such as competition and exploitation that stand in the way of creative
      work for the rest of the labouring population. Science can therefore be
      transformed in the same way as all other forms of labour, through a
      revolution in the mode of production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Science puts into our hands the means of satisfying our material needs. It
      gives us also the ideas which will enable us to understand, to
      co-ordinate, and to satisfy our needs in the social sphere. Beyond this
      science has something as important though less definite to offer: a
      reasonable hope in the unexplored possibilities of the future.<sup

      Following this quotation from the final chapter of
      <em>The Social Function of Science</em>, Bernal outlines the historic role
      of capitalism in the early development of science, and argues that
      capitalism must now be overcome if science is to fully develop its social
      function.<sup

      The new form it takes for Bernal is essentially one which is united with
      labour; where science is the embodiment of human collective activity and
      the essence of the development of our species. This comes with embracing
      dialectical materialism, the unity of manual and mental work,<sup

      and the realisation of unalienated labour. Under communism science becomes
      the realm in which human development occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind of society where this new science can take hold is one in which
      the models showing the need to decrease material throughput do not apply.
      The kind of technological innovations that would come from a society of
      associated producers, working collectively towards meeting human needs,
      faces none of the social challenges posed by capitalism. Natural limits
      still exist, but their relatively would be realised directly through the
      development of human abilities to effectively infinitely increase
      efficiency and the pool of resources that could be drawn from.<sup

        [A]t every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature
        like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside
        nature – but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and
        exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact
        that we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to
        know and correctly apply its laws.
      </p>

        And, in fact, with every day that passes we are learning to understand
        its laws more correctly… But the more this happens the more will men not

      Rather than the passive harmony imagined in Saito’s degrowth communism,
      humans’ unalienated creative powers could be directed towards expanding
      the realm of freedom while rationally managing natural metabolism. Some
      glimpses of this future were seen in the early years of post-revolutionary
      Russia,<sup

      it is not a simple faith in future technologies that allows for a belief
      in growth communism, but in the abilities of a cooperative and unalienated
      humanity to master nature through collective labour and science. This
      mastery is evidently not in the sense of a master over a slave, as humans
      wouldn’t lord over nature but remain a part of it, but mastery in the way
      a tradesperson masters their craft. Communist society would have an
      intimate knowledge of and interrelation through labour with the natural
      world, shaping it to fit their needs, but while managing nature and
      maintaining sustainability for future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarise: the possibility of a communism with growth rests on the
      revolutionary transformation of science that would occur in a society of
      associated producers. Just as past human societies have had their
      capacities expanded through innovative technologies and social
      organisations, the rational and collective control of our environment
      under communism would allow the continual transcendence of each relative
      limit that may be imposed.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude I want to imagine a deep future communist society: one in
      which the laws of nature are so well understood that human society has
      completely conquered the challenges of the present – hunger, cold, climate
      change and so on. Motivated only by the human ethic of increasing freedom,
      this society could harvest the resources of entire planets, the energy of
      stars, without there being some dramatic revenge of nature, thanks to our
      collective scientific mastery. People will spend their free time
      labouring, but the necessary labour of ensuring everyone is housed, fed,
      clothed and so on is driven down to the absolute minimum. This would free
      up people to work creatively and scientifically, advancing upon old
      techniques of production to further decrease the necessary labour or
      spending their time dedicated to the arts. This is not a utopian future,
      but one based on the material interests of the working class. It is
      incompatible with the actual utopian and anti-human degrowth vision of the
      future, in which people are somehow motivated by maintaining limits on
      their own freedom and incapable of growing without destroying the
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be clear, this scenario does not discount the reality of relative
      physical limits and boundaries that would have to be worked within. And
      this is especially the case for a post-revolutionary society in the short
      and medium term, where net degrowth may very well be a necessary feature
      of the transition from capitalism, in a not dissimilar way to how a
      workers’ state would temporarily require a military force. However, this
      is not something that can be prescribed, it must be left up to the
      collective decision of the international working class who make the
      revolution, no matter how compelling modern research is on the need to
      degrow our capitalist economy. It is on this limited basis that Marxist
      theory has anything to gain from degrowth; the synthesis attempted by
      Saito amounts to making a principle out of potential necessity and
      distorts Marx and Marxism to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite there being nothing to add to Marxism from degrowth, I hope that
      this article shows the utility of a deep engagement with contrary
      perspectives on the climate crisis, and even of speculating about the
      nature of a communist society based on a Marxist understanding of nature
      and humans’ relation to it. And through analysing the ongoing debate
      between degrowth and green growth a number of key points emerge, including
      a development of the distinction between universal and historically
      contingent relations, a discussion of production and science, and the
      centrality of freedom to the Marxist theory of international working-class
      revolution. It is this last point, the humanist essence of Marxism, that
      makes any form of degrowth incompatible with the socialist and workers’
      movements.

        While Hickel does advocate for mass activity, as in Hickel 2022b, it is
        clear that the bulk of his work is oriented towards providing solid
        policy proposals that convince regular people, rather than the
        self–activity of workers being the solution.

        Kallis 2019a. Here Kallis has an interesting discussion of Marxist
        terminology as historically specific to analysing capitalism, while the
        terms “accumulation” and “surplus” are more universal. A similar
        discussion will occur later in this article.

        The context Marx was writing in meant that his emphasis when speaking of
        historical materialism was on the forces of production as the basis for
        a materialist conception of history contra the idealist historiography
        of his various bourgeois and utopian contemporaries.

        For more evidence of Marx not abandoning historical materialism late in
        life, see the final paragraph of chapter 51 of Marx 1981, pp.1023–4
        (Capital, Volume III), where he discusses with much nuance how
        production is essential to the transformation of the social form of
        production.
