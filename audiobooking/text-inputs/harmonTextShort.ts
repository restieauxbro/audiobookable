export const harmonTextShort = `The politics of the Middle East and beyond have been dominated by Islamist movements at least since the Iranian revolution of 1978-9. Variously described in 
the West as “Islamic fundamentalism”, “Islamicism”, “integrism”, “political 
Islam” and “Islamic revivalism”, these movements stand for the “regeneration” 
of society through a return to the original teachings of the prophet Mohammed. 
They have become a major force in Iran and the Sudan (where they still hold 
power), Egypt, Algeria and Tajikistan (where they are involved in bitter armed 
struggles against the state), Afghanistan (where rival Islamist movements have 
been waging war with each other since the collapse of the pro-Russian 
government), the occupied West Bank of the Jordan (where their militancy is 
challenging the old PLO hegemony over the Palestinian resistance), Pakistan 
(where they make up a significant portion of the opposition) and most recently 
Turkey (where the Welfare Party has taken control of Istanbul, Ankara and many 
other municipalities). 
 
The rise of these movements has been an enormous shock to the liberal 
intelligentsia and has produced a wave of panic among people who believed that 
“modernisation”, coming on top of the victory of the anti-colonial struggles of 
the 1950s and 1960s, would inevitably lead to more enlightened and less 
repressive societies.  
 
Instead they witness the growth of forces which seem to look back to a more 
restricted society which forces women into purdah, uses terror to crush free 
thought and threatens the most barbaric punishments on those who defy its 
edicts. In countries like Egypt and Algeria the liberals are now lining up with the 
state, which has persecuted and imprisoned them in the past, in the war it is 
waging against Islamist parties. 
 
But it has not only been liberals who have been thrown into disarray by the rise 
of Islamism. So too has the left. It has not known how to react to what it sees as 
an obscurantist doctrine, backed by traditionally reactionary forces, enjoying 
success among some of the poorest groups in society. Two opposed approaches 
have resulted. 
 
The first has been to see Islamism as Reaction Incarnate, as a form of fascism. 
This was, for example, the position taken soon after the Iranian revolution by the 
then left wing academic Fred Halliday, who referred to the Iranian regime as 
                                                 
Islamism in various forms has clearly been a significant political force in Nigeria from the Sharia movement in some northern 
states to Boko Haram and the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (Shiites).
 
“Islam with a fascist face”.  It is an approach which much of the Iranian left 
came to adopt after the consolidation of the Khomeini regime in 1981-2. And it is 
accepted by much of the left in Egypt and Algeria today. Thus, for example, one 
Algerian revolutionary Marxist group has argued that the principles, ideology 
and political action of the Islamist FIS “are similar to those of the National Front 
in France”, and that it is “a fascist current”.
 
Such an analysis easily leads to the practical conclusion of building political 
alliances to stop the fascists at all costs. Thus Halliday concluded that the left in 
Iran made the mistake of not allying with the “liberal bourgeoisie” in 1979-81 in 
opposition to “the reactionary ideas and policies of Khomeini”.  In Egypt 
today the left, influenced by the mainstream communist tradition, effectively 
supports the state in its war against the Islamists. 
 
The opposite approach has been to see the Islamist movements as “progressive”, 
“anti-imperialist” movements of the oppressed. This was the position taken by 
the great bulk of the Iranian left in the first phase of the 1979 revolution, when 
the Soviet influenced Tudeh Party, the majority of the Fedayeen guerrilla 
organisation and the left Islamist People’s Mojahedin all characterised the forces 
behind Khomeini as “the progressive petty bourgeoisie”. The conclusion of this 
approach was that Khomeini deserved virtually uncritical support.  A quarter 
of a century before this the Egyptian Communists briefly took the same position 
towards the Muslim Brotherhood, calling on them to join in “a common struggle 
against the ‘fascist dictatorship’ of Nasser and his ‘Anglo-American props’”.  
 
I want to argue that both positions are wrong. They fail to locate the class 
character of modern Islamism or to see its relationship to capital, the state and 
imperialism. 
   
Islam, religion and ideology 
The confusion often starts with a confusion about the power of religion itself. 
Religious people see it as a historical force in its own right, whether for good or 
for evil. So too do most bourgeois anti-clerical and free thinkers. For them, 
fighting the influence of religious institutions and obscurantists ideas is in itself 
the way to human liberation. 
 
But although religious institutions and ideas clearly play a role in history, this 
does not happen in separation from the rest of material reality. Religious 
institutions, with their layers of priests and teachers, arise in a certain society and 
interact with that society. They can only maintain themselves as society changes if they find some way of changing their own base of support. So, for instance, 
one of the world’s major religious institutions, the Roman Catholic Church, 
originated in the late ancient world and survived by adapting itself first to feudal 
society for 1,000 years and then, with much effort, to the capitalist society that 
replaced feudalism, changing much of the content of its own teaching in the 
process. People have always been capable of giving different interpretations to 
the religious ideas they hold, depending on their own material situation, their 
relations with other people and the conflicts they get involved in. History is full 
of examples of people who profess nearly identical religious beliefs ending up on 
opposite sides in great social conflicts. This happened with the social convulsions 
which swept Europe during the great crisis of feudalism in the 16th and 17th 
century, when Luther, Calvin, Munzer and many other “religious” leaders 
provided their followers with a new world view through a reinterpretation of 
biblical texts. 
 
Islam is no different to any other religion in these respects. It arose in one 
context, among a trading community in the towns of 7th century Arabia, in the 
midst of a society still mainly organised on a tribal basis. It flourished within the 
succession of great empires carved out by some of those who accepted its 
doctrines. It persists today as the official ideology of numerous capitalist states 
(Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Iran etc), as well as the inspiration of many 
oppositional movements. 
 
It has been able to survive in such different societies because it has been able to 
adapt to differing class interests. It has obtained the finance to build its mosques 
and employ its preachers in turn from the traders of Arabia, the bureaucrats, 
landowners and merchants of the great empires, and the industrialists of modern 
capitalism. But at the same time it has gained the allegiance of the mass of 
people by putting across a message offering consolation to the poor and 
oppressed. At every point its message has balanced between promising a degree 
of protection to the oppressed and providing the exploiting classes with 
protection against any revolutionary overthrow. 
 
So Islam stresses that the rich have to pay a 2.5 percent Islamic tax (the zakat) for 
the relief of the poor, that rulers have to govern in a just way, that husbands must 
not mistreat their wives. But it also treats the expropriation of the rich by the 
poor as theft, insists disobedience to a “just” government is a crime to be 
punished with all the vigour of the law and provides women with fewer rights 
than men within marriage, over inheritance, or over the children in the event of 
divorce. It appeals to the wealthy and the poor alike by offering regulation of  
 
oppression, both as a bulwark against still harsher oppression and as a bulwark 
against revolution. It is, like Christianity, Hinduism or Buddhism, both the heart 
of the heartless world and the opium of the people. 
 
But no set of ideas can have such an appeal to different classes, especially when 
society is shaken by social convulsions, unless it is full of ambiguities. It has to 
be open to differing interpretations, even if these set its adherents at each other’s 
throats. 
 
This has been true of Islam virtually from its inception. After Mohammed’s death 
in 632 AD, just two years after Islam had conquered Mecca, dissension broke out 
between the followers of Abu Bakr, who became the first Caliph (successor to 
Mohammed as leader of Islam), and Ali, husband of the prophet’s daughter 
Fatima. Ali claimed that some of Abu Bakr’s rulings were oppressive. 
Dissension grew until rival Muslim armies fought each other at the battle of the 
Camel resulting in 10,000 deaths. It was out of this dissension that the separation 
of the Sunni and Shia versions of Islam arose. This was but the first of many 
splits. Groups repeatedly arose who insisted that the oppressed were suffering at 
the hands of the godless and demanded a return to the original “pure” Islam of 
the prophet’s time. As Akbar S. Ahmed says: 
 
Throughout Islamic history, Muslim leaders would preach a move to the ideal ... 
They gave expression to often vague ethnic, social or political movements ... The 
basis was laid for the entire schismatic gamut in Islamic thought from the Shia, 
with its offshoots like the Ismailis, to more temporary movements ... Muslim 
history is replete with Mahdis leading revolts against established authority and 
often dying for their efforts ... Leaders have often been poor peasants and from 
deprived ethnic groups. Using Islamic idiom has reinforced their sense of 
deprivation and consolidated the movement.  
 
But even mainstream Islam is not, in its popular forms at least, a homogenous set 
of beliefs. The spread of the religion to cover the whole region from the Atlantic 
coast of north west Africa to the Bay of Bengal involved the incorporation into 
Islamic society of peoples who fitted into Islam many of their old religious 
practices, even if these contradicted some of Islam’s original tenets. So popular 
Islam often includes cults of local saints or of holy relics even though orthodox 
Islam regards such practices as sacrilegious idolatry. And Sufi brotherhoods 
flourish which, while not constituting a formal rival to mainstream Islam, put an 
emphasis on mystical and magical experience which many fundamentalists find 
objectionable.
 
In such a situation, any call for a return to the practices of the prophet’s time is 
not in reality about conserving the past but about reshaping people’s behaviour 
into something quite new. 
 
This has been true of Islamic revivalism over the last century. It arose as an 
attempt to come to terms with the material conquest and cultural transformation 
of Asia and North Africa by capitalist Europe. The revivalists argued this had 
only been possible because the original Islamic values had been corrupted by the 
worldly pursuits of the great medieval empires. Regeneration was only possible 
by reviving the founding spirit of Islam as expressed by the first four Caliphs (or, 
for Shiites, by Ali). It was in this spirit that Khomeini, for instance, could 
denounce virtually the whole history of Islam for the last 1,300 years: 
 
Unfortunately, true Islam lasted for only a brief period after its inception. First 
the Umayyids [the first Arab dynasty after Ali] and then the Abbasids [who 
conquered them in 750 AD] inflicted all kinds of damage on Islam. Later the 
monarchs ruling Iran continued in the same path; they completely distorted Islam 
and established something quite diferent in its place.  
 
So, although Islamism can be presented by both defenders and opponents as a 
traditionalist doctrine, based on a rejection of the modern world, in reality things 
are more complicated than this. The aspiration to recreate a mythical past 
involves not leaving existing society intact, but recasting it. What is more, the 
recasting cannot aim to produce a carbon copy of 7th century Islam, since the 
Islamists do not reject every feature of existing society. By and large they accept 
modern industry, modern technology and much of the science on which it is 
based – indeed, they argue that Islam, as a more rational and less superstitious 
doctrine than Christianity, is more in tune with modern science. And so the 
“revivalists” are, in fact, trying to bring about something which has never existed 
before, which fuses ancient traditions and the forms of modern social life. 
 
This means it is wrong simply to refer to all Islamists as “reactionary”, or to 
equate “Islamic fundamentalism” as a whole with the sort of Christian 
fundamentalism which is the bastion of the right wing of the Republican Party in 
the US. Figures like Khomeini, the heads of the rival Mujahedin groups in 
Afghanistan or the leaders of the Algerian FIS may use traditionalist themes and 
appeal to the nostalgia of disappearing social groups, but they also appeal to 
radical currents produced as society is transformed by capitalism. Olivier Roy, 
referring to the Afghan Islamists, argues that: 
 
Fundamentalism is quite different (to traditionalism): for fundamentalism it is of 
paramount importance to get back to the scriptures, clearing away the 
obfuscation of tradition. It always seeks a return to a former state: it is 
characterised by the practice of re-reading texts and a search for origins. The 
enemy is not modernity but tradition, or rather, in the context of Islam, of 
everything which is not the Tradition of the Prophet. This is true reform ...  
 
Traditionalist Islam is an ideology which seeks to perpetuate a social order which 
is being undermined by the development of capitalism – or at least, as with the 
version promoted by the ruling family in Saudi Arabia, to hark back to this order 
in order to conceal the transformation of an old ruling class into modern 
capitalists. Islamism is an ideology which, although it appeals to some of the 
same themes, seeks to transform society, not to conserve it in the old way. For 
this reason, even the term “fundamentalism” is not really appropriate. As 
Abrahamian has observed: 
 
The label “fundamentalism” implies religious inflexibility, intellectual purity, 
political traditionalism, even social conservatism and the centrality of scriptural-
doctrinal principles. “Fundamentalism” implies rejection of the modern 
world.  
 
But, in fact, movements like that of Khomeini in Iran have been based on 
“ideological adaptability and intellectual flexibility, with political protests against 
the established order, and with socio-economic issues that fuel mass opposition 
to the status quo”.  
 
Yet there is often a blurring of the differences between Islamism and 
traditionalism. Precisely because the notion of social regeneration is wrapped in 
religious language, it is open to different interpretations. It can mean simply 
ending “degenerate practices” through a return to the forms of behaviour which 
allegedly preceded the “corruption” of Islam” by “cultural imperialism”. The 
stress then is on female “modesty” and the wearing of the veil, an end to 
“promiscuous” mixing of the sexes in schools and workplaces, opposition to 
Western popular music and so on. Thus one of the most popular leaders of the 
Algerian FIS, Ali Belhadj, can denounce the “violence” against Muslims that 
comes from “cultural invasion”: 
 
We Muslims believe that the most serious form of violence we have suffered is 
not physical violence, for which we are ready ... It is the violence which 
 
represents a challenge to the Muslim community by the imposition of diabolical 
legislation instead of the sharia ... 
 
Is there any violence worse than that which consists in encouraging that which 
God has forbidden? They open wine making enterprises, the work of the demon, 
and they are protected by the police ... 
 
Can you conceive of any violence greater than that of this woman who burns the 
scarf in a public place, in the eyes of everyone, saying the Family Code penalises 
women and finding support from the effeminised, the halfmen and the 
transexuals ... 
 
It is not violence to demand that woman stays at home, in an atmosphere of 
chastity, reserve and humility and that she only goes out in cases of necessity 
defined by the legislator ... to demand the segregation of sexes among school 
students and the absence of that stinking mixing that causes sexual violence 
...  
 
But regeneration can also mean challenging the state and elements of 
imperialism’s political domination. Thus the Iranian Islamists did close down the 
biggest US “listening” station in Asia and seize control of the US embassy. The 
Hezbollah in the southern Lebanon and Hamas in the West Bank and Gaza have 
played a key role in the armed struggle against Israel. The Algerian FIS did 
organise huge demonstrations against the US war against Iraq – even though 
these lost them their Saudi funding. Regeneration can even mean, in certain 
instances, giving support to the material struggles against exploitation of workers 
and peasants, as with the Iranian Mujahedin in 1979-82. 
 
The different interpretations of regeneration naturally appeal to those from 
different social classes. But the religious phraseology can prevent those involved 
recognising their differences with one another. In the heat of the struggle 
individuals can mix the meanings together, so that the fight against the unveiling 
of women is seen as the fight against the Western oil companies and the abysmal 
poverty of the mass of people. Thus in Algeria in the late 1980s, Belhadj, made himself the voice of all those with nothing to lose ... Conceiving Islam in 
its most pure scriptural form, he preached strict application of its commandments 
... Every Friday Belhadj made war against the entire world, Jews and Christians, 
Zionists, communists and secularists, liberals and agnostics, governments of the 
 East and the West, Arab or Muslim heads of state, Westernised party leaders and 
intellectuals, were the favourite targets of his weekly preaching.  
 
Yet beneath this confusion of ideas there were real class interests at work. 
   
The class base of Islamism 
Islamism has arisen in societies traumatised by the impact of capitalism – first in 
the form of external conquest by imperialism and then, increasingly, by the 
transformation of internal social relations accompanying the rise of a local 
capitalist class and the formation of an independent capitalist state. 
 
Old social classes have been replaced by new ones, although not instantaneously 
or in a clear cut manner. What Trotsky described as “combined and uneven 
development” has occurred. Externally, colonialism has retreated, but the great 
imperialist powers – especially the US – continue to use their military forces as a 
bargaining tool to influence the production of the Middle East’s single major 
resource, oil. Internally, state encouragement – and often ownership – has led to 
the development of some large scale modern industry, but large sectors of 
“traditional” industry remain, based on vast numbers of small workshops where 
the owner works with a couple of workers, often from his own family. Land 
reform has turned some peasants into modern capitalist farmers – but displaced 
many more, leaving them with little or no land, so forcing them to eke out a 
livelihood from casual labour in the workshops or markets of sprawling urban 
slums. A massive expansion of the education system is turning out vast numbers 
of high school and college graduates, but these then find insufficient job 
opportunities in the modern sectors of the economy and place their hopes on 
getting into the state bureaucracy, while eking out a living with scraps of work 
around the informal sector – touting for custom from shopkeepers, acting as 
guides for tourists, selling lottery tickets, driving taxis and so on. 
 
The crises of the world economy over the last 20 years have aggravated all these 
contradictions. The modern industries have found the national economy too small 
for them to operate efficiently, but the world economy too competitive for them 
to survive without state protection. The traditional industries have not generally 
been able to modernise without state support and they cannot compensate for the 
failure of modern industry to provide jobs for the burgeoning urban population. 
But a few sectors have managed to establish links of their own with international 
capital and increasingly resent the state’s domination of the economy. The urban 
rich increasingly lap up the luxury goods available on the world market, creating 
growing resentment among the casual workers and the unemployed. 
 
Islamism represents an attempt to come to terms with these contradictions by 
people who have been brought up to respect traditional Islamic ideas. But it does 
not find its support equally in all sections of society. For some sections embrace 
a modern secular bourgeois or nationalist ideology, while other sections gravitate 
towards some form of secular working class response. The Islamic revival gets 
sustenance from four different social groupings – each of which interprets Islam 
in its own way. 
   
1. The Islamism of the old exploiters: First there are those members of the 
traditional privileged classes who fear losing out in the capitalist modernisation 
of society – particularly landowners (including clergy dependent on incomes 
from land belonging to religious foundations), traditional merchant capitalists, 
the owners of the mass of small shops and workshops. Such groups have often 
been the traditional sources of finance for the mosques and see Islam as a way of 
defending their established way of life and of making those who oversee change 
listen to their voices. Thus in Iran and Algeria it was this group which provided 
the resources to the clergy to oppose the state’s land reform programme in the 
1960s and 1970s. 
  
2. The Islamism of the new exploiters: Second, often emerging from among this 
first group, are some of the capitalists who have enjoyed success despite hostility 
from those groups linked to the state. In Egypt, for instance, the present day 
Muslim Brotherhood “wormed their way into the economic fabric of Sadat’s 
Egypt at a time when whole sections of it had been turned over to unregulated 
capitalism. Uthman Ahmad Uthman, the Egyptian Rockefeller, made no secret of 
this sympathy for the Brethren”.  
 
In Turkey the Welfare Party, which is led by a former member of the main 
conservative party, enjoys the support of much of middle sized capital. In Iran 
among the bazaaris who gave support to Khomeini against the Shah were 
substantial capitalists resentful at the way economic policies favoured those close 
to the crown. 
  
iii. The Islamism of the poor: The third group are the rural poor who have 
suffered under the advance of capitalist farming and who have been forced into 
the cities as they desperately look for work. Thus in Algeria out of a total rural 
population of 8.2 million only 2 million gained anything from the land reform. 
The other 6 million were faced with the choice between increased poverty in the 
countryside and going to the cities to seek work.  But in the cities: “The lowest group are the hard core jobless made up of displaced former peasants who 
have flooded the cities in search of work and social opportunity ... detached from 
rural society without being truly integrated into urban society”.  
 
They lost the certainties associated with an old way of life – certainties which 
they identify with traditional Muslim culture – without gaining a secure material 
existence or a stable way of life: “Clear guidelines for behaviour and belief no 
longer exist for millions of Algerians caught between a tradition that no longer 
commands their total loyalty and a modernism that cannot satisfy the 
psychological and spiritual needs of young people in particular”.  
 
But it is not only hostility to the state that makes ex-peasants receptive to the 
message of the Islamists. The mosques provide a social focus for people lost in a 
new and strange city, the Islamic charities the rudiments of welfare services 
(clinics, schooling, etc) which are lacking from the state.  
 
iv. The Islamism of the new middle class: However, neither the “traditional” 
exploiting classes nor the impoverished masses provide the vital element which 
sustains revivalist, political Islam – the cadre of activists who propagate its 
doctrines and risk injury, imprisonment and death in confrontation with their 
enemies. 
 
The traditional exploiting classes are by their very nature conservative. They are 
prepared to donate money so that others can fight – especially in defence of their 
material interests. But they are wary of putting their own businesses, let alone 
their own lives, at risk. And so they can hardly be the force that has torn societies 
like Algeria and Egypt apart, caused a whole town, Hama, to rise in revolt in 
Syria, used suicide bombs against the Americans and Israelis in Lebanon – and 
which caused the Iranian Revolution to take a turn much more radical than any 
section of the Iranian bourgeoisie expected. 
 
This force, in fact, comes from a fourth, very different stratum – from a section 
of the new middle class that has arisen as a result of capitalist modernisation 
right across the Third World. 
 
Writing of the People’s Mojahedin of Iran, Abrahamian comments that many 
studies of the first years of the Iranian Revolution have talked of the appeal of 
radical Islam to the “oppressed”, but that it was not the oppressed in general who 
formed the basis of the Mojahedin; rather it was that very large section of the 
new middle class whose parents had been part of the traditional petty bourgeoisie. He gives breakdowns of the occupations of Mojahedin arrested 
under the Shah and subject to repression under Khomeini to support his 
argument.  
 
Although the third Islamist force, the ultimately victorious Islamic Republican 
Party of Khomeini, is usually thought of as run by the clergy linked to the 
traditional bazaari merchant capitalists, Moaddel has shown that more than half 
its MPs were from the professions, teachers, government employees or students – 
even if a quarter came from bazaari families.     And Bayat has noted that in 
their struggle to defeat the workers’ organisations in the factories, the regime 
could rely on the professional engineers who worked there.  
 
Azar Tabari notes that after the downfall of the Shah very large numbers of 
women in the Iranian cities opted to wear the veil and lined up with the followers 
of Khomeini against the left. She claims these women came from that section of 
the middle class that was the first generation to undergo a process of “social 
integration”. Often from traditional petty bourgeois families – with fathers who 
were bazaar merchants, tradesmen and so on – they were forced into higher 
education as traditional opportunities for their families to make money declined 
with industrialisation. There were openings for them in professions like teaching 
and nursing. But “these women had to go through the often painful and traumatic 
experience of first generation adjustment”: 
 
As the young women from such families began to go to universities or work in 
hospitals, all these traditional concepts came under daily attack from “alien” 
surroundings, where women mixed with men, wore no veils, and sometimes 
dressed according to the latest European fashions. Women were often torn 
between accepted family norms and the pressure of the new environment. They 
could not be veiled at work, nor could they leave home unveiled. 
 
One widespread response to these contradictory pressures was “a retreat into 
Islam”, “symbolised by deliberately veiled women demonstrators during large 
mobilisations”. Tabari claims this response stood in marked contrast to that of 
women whose families had been part of the new middle class for two or three 
generations, and who refused to wear the veil and identified with the liberals or 
the left.  In Afghanistan, Roy notes: 
 
The Islamist movement was born in the modern sectors of society and developed 
from a critique of the popular movements that preceded it ... The Islamists are 
intellectuals, the products of modernist enclaves within traditional society; their 
 
social origins are what we have termed the state bourgeoisie – products of the 
government education system which only leads to employment in the state 
machine ... The Islamists are products of the state educational system. Very few 
of them have an education in the arts. On the campus they mostly mix with the 
Communists, with whom they are violently opposed, rather that with 
the ulama [religious scholars] towards whom they have an ambivalent attitude. 
They share many beliefs in common with the ulama, but Islamist thought has 
developed from contact with the great western ideologies, which they see as 
holding the key to the west’s technical development. For them, the problem is to 
develop a modern political ideology based upon Islam, which they see as the 
only way to come to terms with the modern world and the best means of 
confronting foreign imperialism.  
 
In Algeria the most important recruitment ground for the FIS has been among 
Arabic speaking (as opposed to French speaking) high school and university 
students, and that wide section of youth that would like to be students but cannot 
get college places: 
 
The FIS draws its membership from three sections of the population: the 
commercial middle classes, including some who are quite rich, a mass of young 
people who are unemployed and excluded from higher education, forming the 
new lumpen proletariat of the streets, and a layer of upwardly mobile Arab 
speaking intellectuals. These last two groups are the most numerous and 
important.  
 
The Islamic intellectuals have made careers for themselves through their 
domination of the theological and Arab language faculties of the universities, 
using these to gain control of many of the positions as imams in the mosques and 
teachers in the lycees (high schools). They form a network that ensures the 
recruitment of more Islamists to such positions and the inculcation of Islamist 
ideas into the new generation of students. This in turn has enabled them to exert 
influence over vast numbers of young people. 
 
Ahmed Rouadia writes that the Islamist groups began to grow from the mid-
1970s onwards, receiving support in the universities from Arab speaking students 
who found their lack of fluency in French kept them from getting jobs in 
administration, areas of advanced technology and higher management.  Thus, 
there was, for instance, a bitter conflict with the principal of Constantine 
university in the mid-1980s, who was accused of impugning the “dignity of Arab 
language” and “being loyal to French colonialism” for allowing French to remain 
the predominant language in the science and technology faculties : 
 
The qualified Arab speakers find access blocked to all the key sectors, above all 
in industries requiring technical knowledge and foreign languages ... The Arab 
speakers, even if they have diplomas, cannot get a place in modern industry. For 
the most part they end by turning towards the mosque.  
 
The students, the recent Arab speaking graduates and, above all, the unemployed 
ex-students form a bridge to the very large numbers of discontented youth 
outside the colleges who find they cannot get college places despite years spent 
in an inefficient and underfunded educational system. Thus, although there are 
now nearly a million students in secondary education, up to four fifths of them 
can expect to fail the bacalauriate – the key to entry into university – and to face 
a life of insecurity on the margins of employment:  
 
Integrism [Islamism] gets its strength from the social frustrations which afflict a 
large part of the youth, those left out of account by the social and economic 
system. Its message is simple: If there is poverty, hardship and frustration, it is 
because those who have power do not base themselves on the legitimacy 
of shorah [consultation], but simply on force ... The restoration of the Islam of 
the first years would make the inequalities disappear.  
 
And through its influence over a wide layer of students, graduates and the 
intellectual unemployed, Islamism is able to spread out to dominate the 
propagation of ideas in the slums and shanty towns where the expeasants live. 
Such a movement cannot be described as a “conservative” movement. The 
educated, Arab speaking youth do not turn to Islam because they want things to 
stay as they are, but because they believe it offers massive social change.  
 
The Islamist student associations which became a dominant force in Egyptian 
universities during Sadat’s presidency “constituted the Islamicist movement’s 
only genuine mass organisations”.  They grew in reaction to conditions in the 
universities and to the dismal prospects facing students if they succeeded in 
graduating: 
 
The number of students rose from slightly less than 200,000 in 1970 to more than 
half a million in 1977 ... In the absence of the necessary resources, providing free 
high education for the greatest possible number of the country’s youth has 
produced a system of cut rate education.  

Overcrowding represents a particular problem for female students, who find 
themselves subject to all sorts of harassment in the lecture theatres and 
overcrowded buses. In response to this situation, 
 
The jamaa al islamiyya [Islamic associations] drew their considerable strength 
from their ability to identify [these problems] and to pose immediate solutions – 
for instance, using student unions funds to run minibuses for female students 
[giving priority to those who wore the veil], calling for separate rows in the 
lecture theatres for women and men, organising course revision groups which 
met in the mosques, turning out cheap editions of essential textbooks.  
 
Graduating students do not escape the endemic poverty of much of Egyptian 
society: 
 
Every graduate has the right to public employment. This measure is actually the 
purveyor of massive disguised unemployment in the offices of a swollen 
administration in which employees are badly paid ... He can still manage to feed 
himself by buying the state subsidised products, but he is unlikely to rise above 
the bare level of subsistence ... Almost every state employee has a second or a 
third job ... Innumerable employees who sit all morning at desks in one or other 
of the countless ministry offices spend the afternoon working as plumbers or taxi 
drivers, jobs they perform so inadequately they might as well be filled by 
illiterates ... An illiterate peasant woman who arrives in the city to land a job as a 
foreigner’s maid will be paid more or less double the salary of a university 
assistant lecturer.  
 
The only way to get out of this morass for most graduates is to get a job abroad, 
especially in Saudi Arabia or the Gulf states. And this is not just the only way out 
of poverty, it is, for most people, the precondition for getting married in a society 
where pre-marital sexual relations are rare. 
 
The Islamists were able to articulate these problems in religious language. As 
Kepel writes of one of the leaders of one of the early Islamist sects, his position 
does not involve “acting as a fanatic for a bygone century ... He is putting his 
finger – in his own way – on a crucial problem of contemporary Egyptian 
society”.  
 
As in Algeria, once the Islamists had established a mass base in the universities, 
they were then in a situation to spread out into a wider milieu – the milieu of the impoverished streets of the cities where the students and ex-students mixed with 
a mass of other people scrabbling for a livelihood. This began to happen after the 
regime clamped down hard on the Islamist movement in the universities 
following the negotiation of the peace agreement with Israel in the late 1970s. 
“Far from halting the jamaa, however, this harassment gave them a second wind 
... the message of the jamaa now began to spread beyond the world of students. 
Islamicist cadres and agitators went to preach in the poor neighbourhoods”.  
  
Radical Islam as a social movement 

The class base of Islamism is similar to that of classical fascism and of the Hindu 
fundamentalism of the BJP, Shiv Sena and RSS in India. All these movements 
have recruited from the white collar middle class and students, as well as from 
the traditional commercial and professional petty bourgeoisie. This, together with 
the hostility of most Islamist movements to the left, women’s rights and 
secularism has led many socialist and liberals to designate the movements as 
fascist. But this is a mistake. 
 
The petty bourgeois class base has not only been a characteristic of fascism, it 
has also been a feature of Jacobinism, of Third World nationalisms, of Maoist 
Stalinism, and Peronism. Petty bourgeois movements only become fascist when 
they arise at a specific point in the class struggle and play a particular role. This 
role is not just to mobilise the petty bourgeoisie, but to exploit the bitterness they 
feel at what an acute crisis of the system has done to them and so turn them into 
organised thugs prepared to work for capital to tear workers’ organisations apart. 
 
That is why Mussolini’s and Hitler’s movements were fascist while, say, Peron’s 
movement in Argentina was not. Even though Peron borrowed some of the 
imagery of fascism, he took power in exceptional circumstances which allowed 
him to buy off workers’ organisations while using state intervention to divert the 
profits of the large agrarian capitalists into industrial expansion. During his first 
six years in office a specific set of circumstances allowed real wages to rise by 
about 60 percent. This was the complete opposite to what would have happened 
under a genuinely fascist regime. Yet the liberal intelligentsia and the Argentine 
Communist Party were still capable of referring to the regime as “Nazi 
Peronism”, in much the same way that much of the left internationally refers to 
Islamism today.  
 
The Islamist mass movements in countries like Algeria and Egypt likewise play a 
different role to that of fascism. They are not primarily directed against workers’ 
organisations and do not offer themselves to the main sectors of capital as a way 
 
of solving its problems at workers’ expense. They are often involved in direct, 
armed confrontation with the forces of the state in a way in which fascist parties 
rarely have been. And, far from being direct agents of imperialism, these 
movements have taken up anti-imperialist slogans and some anti-imperialist 
actions which have embarrassed very important national and international 
capitalist interests (e.g. in Algeria over the second Gulf War, in Egypt against 
“peace” with Israel, in Iran against the American presence in the aftermath of the 
overthrow of the Shah). 
 
Those on the left who see the Islamists simply as “fascists” fail to take into 
account the destabilising effect of the movements on capital’s interests right 
across the Middle East, and end up siding with states that are the strongest 
backers both of imperialism and of local capital. This has, for instance, happened 
to those sections of the left influenced by the remnants of Stalinism in Egypt. It 
happened to much of the Iranian left during the closing stages of the first Gulf 
War, when American imperialism sent in its fleet to fight on the same side as 
Iraq against Iran. And it is in danger of happening to the secular left in Algeria, 
faced with a near civil war between the Islamists and the state. 
 
But if it is wrong to see the Islamist movements as “fascist”, it is just as wrong to 
simply see them as “anti-imperialist” or “anti-state”. They do not just fight 
against those classes and states that exploit and dominate the mass of people. 
They also fight against secularism, against women who refuse to abide by 
Islamic notions of “modesty”, against the left and, in important cases, against 
ethnic or religious minorities. The Algerian Islamists established their hold on 
the universities in the late 1970s and early 1980s by organising “punitive raids” 
against the left with the connivance of the police, and the first person killed by 
them was not a state official but a member of a Trotskyist organisation; another 
of their actions was to denounce Hard Rock Magazine, homosexuality, drugs 
and punk at the Islamic book fair in 1985; in the Algerian towns where they are 
strongest, they do organise attacks on women who dare to show a little of their 
skin; the first public demonstration of the FIS in 1989 was in response to 
“feminist” and “secularist” demonstrations against Islamist violence, of which 
women were the main victims.  Its hostility is directed not just against the 
state and foreign capital, but also against the more than 1 million Algerian 
citizens who, through no fault of their own, have been brought up with French as 
their first language, and the 10 percent of the population who are Berber rather 
than Arabic speakers. 
 
Similarly, in Egypt, the armed Islamic groups do murder secularists and Islamists 
who disagree strongly with them; they do encourage communal hatred by 
Muslims, including pogroms, against the 10 percent of the population who 
happen to be Coptic Christians. In Iran the Khomeini wing of Islamism did 
execute some 100 people for “sexual offences” like homosexuality and adultery 
in 1979-81; they did sack women from the legal system and organise gangs of 
thugs, the Iranian Hezbollah, to attack unveiled women and to assault left 
wingers; and they did kill thousands in the repression of the left Islamist People’s 
Mujahedin. In Afghanistan the Islamist organisations which waged a long and 
bloody war against the Russian occupation of their country did turn their heavy 
weaponry on each other once the Russians had left, reducing whole areas of 
Kabul to rubble. 
 
In fact, even when Islamists put the stress on “anti-imperialism”, they more often 
than not let imperialism off the hook. For imperialism today is not usually the 
direct rule of Western states over parts of the Third World, but rather a world 
system of independent capitalist classes (‘private” and state), integrated into a 
single world market. Some ruling classes have greater power than others and so 
are able to impose their own bargaining terms through their control over access 
to trade, the banking system or on occasions crude force. These ruling classes 
stand at the top of a pinnacle of exploitation, but those just below are the ruling 
classes of poorer countries, rooted in the individual national economies, also 
gaining from the system, increasingly linking themselves into the dominant 
multinational networks and buying into the economies of the advanced world, 
even if on occasion they lash out at those above them. 
 
The suffering of the great mass of people cannot simply be blamed on the great 
imperialist powers and their agencies like the World Bank and the IMF. It is also 
a result of the enthusiastic participation in their exploitation by the lesser 
capitalists and their local states. It is these who actually implement the policies 
that impoverish people and wreck their lives. And it is these who use the police 
and the prisons to crush those who try to resist.  The local capitalists and 
governments in the Global South benefit hugely from this exploitation.  So they 
are more than happy (most of the time) to play the role of junior partners to the 
global companies and the major imperialist powers. 
 
There is an important difference here with what happened under the classic 
imperialism of the colonial empires, where Western colonists manned the state 
and directed repression. The local exploiting classes would be pulled two ways, 
between resisting a state when it trampled on their interests, and collaborating 
with it as a bulwark against those they themselves exploited. But they were not 
necessarily in the front line of defending the whole system of exploitation against 
revolt. They are today. They are part of the system, even if they sometimes 
quarrel with it. They are no longer its inconsistent opponents.  
 
In this situation any ideology which restricts itself to targeting foreign 
imperialism as the enemy evades any serious confrontation with the system. It 
expresses people’s bitterness and frustration, but evades focusing it on real 
enemies. This is true of most versions of Islamism, just as it is true these days of 
most Third World nationalisms. They point to a real enemy, the world system, 
and on occasions they clash bitterly with the state. But they absolve from 
responsibility most of the local bourgeoisie – imperialism’s most important long 
term partner. 
 
A recent study of Khomeinism in Iran by Abrahamian compares it with Peronism 
and similar forms of “populism”: 
 
Khomeini adopted radical themes ... At times he sounded more radical than the 
Marxists. But while adopting radical themes he remained staunchly committed to 
the preservation of middle class property. This form of middle class radicalism 
made him akin to Latin American populists, especially the Peronists.  
 
And Abrahamian goes on to say: 
 
By “populism” I mean a movement of the propertied middle class that mobilises 
the lower classes, especially the urban poor, with radical rhetoric directed against 
imperialism, foreign capitalism, and the political establishment ... Populist 
movements promise to drastically raise the standard of living and make the 
country fully independent of outside powers. Even more important in attacking 
the status quo with radical rhetoric, they intentionally stop short of threatening 
the petty bourgeoisie and the whole principle of private property. Populist 
movements thus, inevitably, emphasise the importance, not of economicsocial 
revolution, but of cultural, national and political reconstruction.  
 
Such movements tend to confuse matters by moving from any real struggle 
against imperialism to a purely ideological struggle against what they see as its 
cultural effects. “Cultural imperialism”, rather than material exploitation, is 
identified as the source of everything that is wrong. The fight is then not directed 
against forces really involved in impoverishing people, but rather against those 
who speak “foreign” languages, accept “alien” religions or reject allegedly “traditional” lifestyles. This is very convenient for certain sections of local 
capital who find it easy to practice the “indigenous culture”, at least in public. It 
is also of direct material interest to sections of the middle class who can advance 
their own careers by purging others from their jobs.  
But it limits the dangers such movements present to imperialism as a system. 
 
Islamism, then, both mobilises popular bitterness and paralyses it; both builds up 
people’s feelings that something must be done and directs those feelings into 
blind alleys; both destabilises the state and limits the real struggle against the 
state. 
 
The contradictory character of Islamism follows from the class base of its core 
cadres. The petty bourgeoisie as a class cannot follow a consistent, independent 
policy of its own. This has always been true of the traditional petty bourgeoisie – 
the small shopkeepers, traders and self employed professionals. They have 
always been caught between a conservative hankering for security that looks to 
the past and a hope that they individually will gain from radical change. It is just 
as true of the impoverished new middle class – or the even more impoverished 
would-be new middle class of unemployed ex-students – in the less economically 
advanced countries today. They can hanker after an allegedly golden past. They 
can see their futures as tied up with general social advance through revolutionary 
change. Or they can blame the frustration of their aspirations on other sections of 
the population who have got an “unfair” grip on middle class jobs: the religious 
and ethnic minorities, those with a different language, women working in an 
“untraditional” way. 
 
Which direction they turn in does not just depend on immediate material factors. 
It also depends on the struggles that occur on a national and international scale. 
Thus in the 1950s and 1960s the struggles against colonialism and imperialism 
did inspire much of the aspirant middle class of the Third World, and there was a 
general feeling that state controlled economic development represented the way 
forward. The secular left, or at least its Stalinist or nationalist mainstream, was 
seen as embodying this vision, and it exercised a degree of hegemony in the 
universities. At that stage even those who began with a religious orientation were 
attracted by what was seen as the left – by the example of the Vietnamese War 
against America or by the so called cultural revolution in China – and began to 
reject traditional religious thinking over, for instance, the women’s question. This 
happened with the Catholic liberation theologists in Latin America and the 
People’s Mojahedin in Iran. And even in Afghanistan the Islamist students 
 
demonstrated against Zionism during the six-day war, against American policies 
in Vietnam and the privileges of the establishment. They were violently opposed 
to important figures on the traditionalist side, to the King and especially his 
cousin Daoud ... They protested against foreign influences in Afghanistan, both 
from the Soviet Union and the West, and against the speculators during the 
famine of 1972, by demanding there should be curbs on personal wealth.  
 
In the late 1970s and 1980s the mood changed. On the one hand there was the 
beginning of a global wave of disillusionment with the so called “socialist” 
model presented by the Eastern European states as a result of the killing fields of 
Cambodia, the mini-war between Vietnam and China, and the move of China 
towards the American camp. This disillusionment grew in intensity in the later 
1980s as a result of the changes in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the USSR. 
 
It was even more intense in certain Middle Eastern countries than elsewhere in 
the world because the illusions had not merely been a question of foreign policy. 
The local regimes had claimed to be implementing nationalist versions of 
“socialism”, based to a greater or lesser extent on the East European model. Even 
those on the left who were critical of their governments tended to accept and 
identify with these claims. Thus in Algeria the left in the universities volunteered 
in the early 1970s to go to the countryside to assist in the “land reform”, even 
though the regime had already repressed the left student organisation and was 
maintaining police control over the universities. And in Egypt the Communists 
continued to proclaim Nasser as a socialist, even after he had thrown them into 
prison. So disillusionment with the regime became also, for many people, 
disillusionment with the left. 
 
On the other hand, there was the emergence of certain Islamic states as a political 
force – the seizure of power by Gadaffi in Libya, the Saudi-led oil embargo 
against the West at the time of the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, and then, most 
dramatically, the revolutionary establishment of the Iranian Islamic Republic in 
1979. 
 
Islamism began to dominate among the very layers of students and young people 
who had once looked to the left: in Algeria, for instance, “Khomeini began to be 
regarded by layers of young people as Mao and Guevara once had 
been”.  Support for the Islamist movements went from strength to strength as 
they seemed to offer immanent and radical change. The leaders of the Islamist 
movements were triumphant. 
 
Yet the contradictions in Islamism did not go away, and expressed themselves 
forcefully in the decade that followed. Far from being an unstoppable force, 
Islamism has, in fact, been subject to its own internal pressures which, 
repeatedly, have made its followers turn on one another. Just as the history of 
Stalinism in the Middle East in the 1940s and 1950s was one of failure, betrayals, 
splits and repression, so has the history of Islamism been in the 1980s and 1990s 
[and in to the 21st century]. 
 
Conclusions 

It has been a mistake on the part of socialists to see Islamist movements either as 
automatically reactionary and “fascist” or as automatically “anti-imperialist” and 
“progressive”. Radical Islamism, with its project of reconstituting society on the 
model established by Mohammed in 7th century Arabia, is, in fact, a “utopia” 
emanating from an impoverished section of the new middle class. As with any 
“petty bourgeois utopia” , its supporters are, in practice, faced with a choice 
between heroic but futile attempts to impose it in opposition to those who run 
existing society, or compromising with them, providing an ideological veneer to 
continuing oppression and exploitation. It is this which leads inevitably to splits 
between a radical, terrorist wing of Islamism on the one hand, and a reformist 
wing on the others. It is also this which leads some of the radicals to switch from 
using arms to try to bring about a society without “oppressors” to using them to 
impose “Islamic” forms of behaviour on individuals. 
 
Socialists cannot regard petty bourgeois utopians as our prime enemies. They are 
not responsible for the system of international capitalism, the subjection of 
thousands of millions of people to the blind drive to accumulate, the pillaging of 
whole continents by the banks, or the machinations that have produced a 
succession of horrific wars since the proclamation of the “new world order”. 
They were not responsible for the horrors of the first Gulf War, which began with 
an attempt by Saddam Hussein to do a favour for the US and the Gulf sheikdoms, 
and ended with direct US intervention on Iraq’s side. They were not to blame for 
the carnage in Lebanon, where the Falangist onslaught, the Syrian intervention 
against the left and the Israeli invasion created the conditions which bred militant 
Shiism. They were not to blame for the second Gulf War, with the “precision 
bombing” of Baghdad hospitals and the slaughter of 80,000 people as they fled 
from Kuwait to Basra. Poverty, misery, persecution, suppression of human 
rights, would exist in countries like Egypt and Algeria even if the Islamists 
disappeared tomorrow.
 
For these reasons socialists cannot support the state against the Islamists. Those 
who do so, on the grounds that the Islamists threaten secular values, merely make 
it easier for the Islamists to portray the left as part of an “infidel”, “secularist” 
conspiracy of the “oppressors” against the most impoverished sections of society. 
They repeat the mistakes made by the left in Algeria and Egypt when they 
praised regimes that were doing nothing for the mass of people as “progressive’ – 
mistakes that enabled the Islamists to grow. And they forget that any support the 
state gives to secularist values is only contingent: when it suits it, it will do a deal 
with the more conservative of the Islamists to impose bits of the shariah – 
especially the bits which inflict harsh punishment on people – in return for 
ditching the radicals with their belief in challenging oppression. This is what 
happened in Pakistan under Zia and the Sudan under Nimeiry, and it is 
apparently what the Clinton administration has been advising the Algerian 
generals to do. 
 
But socialists cannot give support to the Islamists either. That would be to call 
for the swapping of one form of oppression for another, to react to the violence 
of the state by abandoning the defence of ethnic and religious minorities, women 
and gays, to collude in scapegoating that makes it possible for capitalist 
exploitation to continue unchecked providing it takes “Islamic” forms. It would 
be to abandon the goal of independent socialist politics, based on workers in 
struggle organising all the oppressed and exploited behind them, for a tail-ending 
of a petty bourgeois utopianism which cannot even succeed in its own terms. 
 
The Islamists are not our allies. They are representatives of a class which seeks to 
influence the working class, and which, in so far as it succeeds, pulls workers 
either in the direction of futile and disastrous adventurism or in the direction of a 
reactionary capitulation to the existing system – or often to the first followed by 
the second. 
 
But this does not mean we can simply take an abstentionist, dismissive attitude to 
the Islamists. They grow on the soil of very large social groups that suffer under 
existing society, and whose feeling of revolt could be tapped for progressive 
purposes, providing a lead came from a rising level of workers’ struggle. And 
even short of such a rise in the struggle, many of the individuals attracted to 
radical versions of Islamism can be influenced by socialists – provided socialists 
combine complete political independence from all forms of Islamism with a 
willingness to seize opportunities to draw individual Islamists into genuinely 
radical forms of struggle alongside them. 
 
Radical Islamism is full of contradictions. The petty bourgeoisie is always pulled 
in two directions – towards radical rebellion against existing society and towards 
compromise with it. And so Islamism is always caught between rebelling in order 
to bring about a complete resurrection of the Islamic community, and 
compromising in order to impose Islamic “reforms”. These contradictions 
inevitably express themselves in the most bitter, often violent, conflicts within 
and between Islamist groups. 
 
Those who treat Islamism as a uniquely reactionary monolith forget that there 
were conflicts between the different Islamists over the attitude they should take 
when Saudi Arabia and Iran were on opposite sides during the first Gulf War. 
There were the arguments that led the FIS in Algeria to break with its Saudi 
backers, or Islamists in Turkey to organise pro-Iraqi demonstrations from Saudi 
financed mosques during the second Gulf War. There are the bitter armed battles 
which wage between the rival Islamist armies in Afghanistan. Today there are 
arguments within the Hamas organisation among Palestinians about whether or 
not they should compromise with Arafat’s rump Palestinian administration – and 
therefore indirectly with Israel – in return for its implementing Islamic laws. 
Such differences in the attitude necessarily arise once “reformist” Islam does 
deals with existing states that are integrated into the world system. For each of 
these states is in rivalry with the others, and each of them strikes its own deals 
with the dominant imperialisms. 
 
Similar differences are bound to arise every time there is a rise in the level of 
workers’ struggle. Those who finance the Islamist organisations will want to end 
such struggle, if not break it. Some of the radical young Islamists will 
instinctively support the struggle. The leaders of the organisations will be stuck 
in the middle, muttering about the need of the employers to show charity and the 
workers forbearance. 
 
Finally, the very development of capitalism itself forces the Islamist leaders to do 
ideological somersaults whenever they get close to power. They counterpose 
“Islamic” to “Western values”. But most so called Western values are not rooted 
in some mythical European culture, but arise out of the development of 
capitalism over the last two centuries. Thus a century and a half ago the dominant 
attitude among the English middle class to sexuality was remarkably similar to 
that preached by the Islamic revivalists today (sex outside of marriage was 
forbidden, women were not supposed to bare even their ankles, illegitimacy was 
a taint people could not live down), and women had fewer rights in some respects 
than most versions of Islam grant them today (inheritance was to the eldest son 

only, while Islam gives the daughter half the son’s portion; there was no right at 
all to divorce, while Islam grants women that right in very restricted 
circumstances). What changed English attitudes was not something inbuilt into 
the Western psyche or any alleged “Judeo-Christian values”, but the impact of 
developing capitalism – the way in which its need for women’s labour power 
forced it to change certain attitudes and, more importantly, put women in a 
situation where they could demand even greater changes. 
 
That is why even in countries where the Catholic church used to be immensely 
strong, like Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain, it has had to accept, reluctantly, a 
diminution in its influence. The countries where Islam is the state religion cannot 
immunise themselves from the pressure for similar changes, however hard they 
try.
 
This is shown by the experience of Iranian Islamic Republic. Despite all the 
propaganda about women’s main role being as mothers and wives and all the 
pressure to drive them out of certain professions like the law, the proportion of 
women in the workforce has grown slightly and they continue to make up 28 
percent of government employees, the same as at the time of the 
revolution.  Against this background, the regime has had to shift its stance 
on birth control, with 23 percent of women using contraceptives , and on 
occasions to relax the strict enforcement of the veil. Although women are denied 
equal rights with men when it comes to divorce and family law, they retain the 
vote (there are two women MPs), attend school, get a quota of places in 
university in all disciplines and are encouraged to study medicine and to receive 
military training.  As Abrahamian notes of Khomeini: 
 
His closest disciples often mocked the “traditionalists” for being “old fashioned”. 
They accused them of obsessing over ritual purity; preventing their daughters 
from going to school; insisting that young girls should be veiled even when no 
men were present; denouncing such intellectual pursuits as art, music and chess 
playing; and, worst of all, refusing to take advantage of newspapers, radios and 
televisions.  
 
None of this should really be surprising. Those who run Iranian capitalism and 
the Iranian state cannot dispense with female labour power in key sections of the 
economy. And those sections of the petty bourgeoisie who have formed the 
backbone of the IRP started sending their daughters to university and to seek 
employment in the 1970s precisely because they wanted the extra salaries – to 
enlarge the family income and to make their daughters more marriageable. They 

have not been willing in the 1980s to write these off in the interests of religious 
piety. 
 
Islamism cannot freeze economic and therefore social development any more 
than any other ideology can. And therefore again and again tensions will arise 
within it and find expression in bitter ideological disputes between its 
proponents. 
 
The Islamist youth are usually intelligent and articulate products of modern 
society. They read books and newspapers and watch televisions, and so know all 
the divisions and clashes within their own movements. However much they may 
close ranks when faced with “secularists”, whether from the left or from the 
bourgeoisie, they will argue furiously with each other – just as the pro-Russian 
and pro-Chinese wings of the apparently monolithic world Stalinist movement 
did 30 years ago. And these arguments will begin to create secret doubts in the 
minds of at least some of them. 
 
Socialists can take advantage of these contradictions to begin to make some of 
the more radical Islamists question their allegiance to its ideas and organisations 
– but only if we can establish independent organisations of our own, which are 
not identified with either the Islamists or the state. 
On some issues we will find ourselves on the same side as the Islamists against 
imperialism and the state. This was true, for instance, in many countries during 
the second Gulf War. It should be true in countries like France or Britain when it 
comes to combating racism. Where the Islamists are in opposition, our rule 
should be, “with the Islamists sometimes, with the state never”. 
 
But even then we continue to disagree with the Islamists on basic issues. We are 
for the right to criticise religion as well as the right to practise it. We are for the 
right not to wear the veil as well as the right of young women in racist countries 
like France to wear it if they so wish. We are against discrimination against Arab 
speakers by big business in countries like Algeria – but we are also against 
discrimination against the Berber speakers and those sections of workers and the 
lower middle class who have grown up speaking French. Above all, we are 
against any action which sets one section of the exploited and oppressed against 
another section on the grounds of religion or ethnic origin. And that means that 
as well as defending Islamists against the state we will also be involved in 
defending women, gays, Berbers or Copts against some Islamists. 
 
When we do find ourselves on the same side as the Islamists, part of our job is to 
argue strongly with them, to challenge them – and not just on their organisations’ 
attitude to women and minorities, but also on the fundamental question of 
whether what is needed is charity from the rich or an overthrow of existing class 
relations. 
 
The left has made two mistakes in relation to the Islamists in the past. The first 
has been to write them off as fascists, with whom we have nothing in common. 
The second has been to see them as “progressives” who must not be criticised. 
These mistakes have jointly played a part in helping the Islamists to grow at the 
expense of the left in much of the Middle East. The need is for a different 
approach that sees Islamism as the product of a deep social crisis which it can do 
nothing to resolve, and which fights to win some of the young people who 
support it to a very different, independent, revolutionary socialist perspective.
