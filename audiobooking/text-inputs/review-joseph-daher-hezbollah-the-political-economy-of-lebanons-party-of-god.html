    Islamist parties of various stripes have been growing in popularity and
    influence for some time now. Their growth is primarily a reaction to the
    authoritarian and neoliberal degeneration of the Arab national regimes of
    the early post-colonial period, and the failure of the left to offer an
    effective alternative. The Middle East has thus not been spared the negative
    short-term effects of the general defeat of “really existing socialism” –
    better understood as Stalinism. We can add to this general picture
    regionally specific events, including the US-sponsored training camps of the
    Afghan Mujahideen in the 1980s,<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >1</a
      ></span
    >
    the legacy of the brutal and highly sectarian US-led occupation of Iraq, the
    intensification of the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. As a result of
    these and other processes, Islamist parties are now dominant in Turkey (AKP)
    and Iraq (Dawa), share power in Tunisia (Ennahda), Palestine (Hamas),
    Lebanon (Hezbollah), and form the main opposition parties in a range of
    other places, notably Egypt (Muslim Brotherhood).
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite these developments, there has been relatively little serious
    theorising or research done on these movements. Discussions of Islamist
    organisations by mainstream academics and journalists often rely on
    simplistic analyses which blend together an extraordinarily broad range of
    organisations and ideologies into the dubious category of “political Islam”
    and, of course, “terrorism”.
  </p>
  <p>
    The left has not been entirely exempt from this intellectually bankrupt and
    politically racist trap. Take the analysis of those who defend the Syrian
    regime, who routinely refer to revolutionaries as “jihadis” and
    “headchoppers”, and refuse to make distinctions between the democratic
    sentiments that motivated the original revolution, the remnants of the Free
    Syrian Army (FSA), moderate Islamist groups, Nusra and ISIS. Any reference
    to Islam in a party’s political program makes one a reactionary, according
    to this view.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this context, it is a breath of fresh air to read Joseph Daher’s
    excellent book,
    <em>Hezbollah: The political economy of Lebanon’s party of god</em>. Clearly
    a product of years of painstaking research, the text synthesises a huge
    amount of statistics, historical background and interviews with key actors
    to produce a detailed picture of the most important party in Lebanese
    politics.

  <h2>Neoliberal Islamism</h2>
  <p>
    The central argument of the book is that Hezbollah has become a party whose
    politics represent the interests of the Shi’ite fraction of the Lebanese
    bourgeoisie. To back up this claim Daher documents the extensive and
    increasing links between the growing layer of Shi’ite capitalists and the
    party hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long dominated by a Maronite and Sunni capitalist class, the eighties and
    nineties saw the rise of a Shi’ite capitalist class focused primarily on
    construction and trade. Rebuilding devastated and highly impoverished areas
    in west and especially south Beirut – areas that have higher concentrations
    of Shi’ite communities – was an avenue for profitable investment for a layer
    of Shi’ite investors. Funded in large part by remittances from successful
    Shi’ite emigrants but also post-war reparations, this investment tended to
    focus on housing and tourism opportunities for middle and upper-income
    Shi’ite families.
  </p>
  <p>
    These investments have generally been organised in the sectarian and
    clientelistic pattern that pervades the rest of Lebanese capitalism. What
    this means is that Hezbollah uses its positions of power to favour Shi’ite
    companies that support its activities, granting them subsidies, construction
    approvals and preferential media coverage. In return it expects absolute
    loyalty, and is prepared to crush those who attempt to forge independent
    economic and political existences in what they perceive to be their
    territories.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, one private company has built a series of religiously informed
    tourism venues across southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah-run Islamic school, the
    building and radio tower for the Hezbollah radio station, and is now gaining
    lucrative government contracts for construction projects in Iraq. This
    latter aspect also highlights the substantial connections between Iranian
    capital and Lebanese Shi’ites, which mirrors the relationship between Saudi
    capital with Lebanese Sunni businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The size and scope of these construction projects massively expanded after
    Israel’s 2006 war on Lebanon, and Hezbollah-linked investors benefitted from
    substantial government handouts for social reconstruction. This initiated a
    virtuous cycle of investment, lending, trade and further investment which,
    although it has not benefited the entire Shi’ite community, has raised tens
    of thousands into the ranks of the middle and upper classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    To prove this, Daher presents data which suggests that although there
    remains a substantial layer of poor and working class Shi’ite (as there is
    for each of the sects), it is now the hinterlands of the northern city of
    Tripoli which suffer from the worst poverty. This is a predominantly Sunni
    area, and in recent times has witnessed a surge in ISIS-style Islamist
    organisations after decades of being taken for granted by urban Sunni
    elites.
  </p>
  <h2>Bourgeois party</h2>
  <p>
    In his seminal 1994 essay, <em>The prophet and the proletariat</em>, British
    Marxist Chris Harman argued that Islamist political organisations attracted
    support from all classes, but emphasised especially the role of impoverished
    middle classes, be they traditional merchants, shopkeepers, clerics or
    low-ranking civil servants. This article was a crucial intervention into
    arguments about how to understand Islamism, putting forward an analysis that
    avoided both Islamophobic hostility and uncritical support. It remains a
    useful reference point for the left in analysing and dealing with such
    organisations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an important and often overlooked section at the beginning of the
    article, Harman refers to the various class bases of Islamist movements. In
    addition to the traditional ruling and middle classes and the poor urban
    classes, he discusses a layer of actual capitalists who back these parties:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Second, often emerging from among [the old exploiting class], are some of
      the capitalists who have enjoyed success despite hostility from those
      groups linked to the state. In Egypt, for instance, the present day Muslim
      Brotherhood “wormed their way into the economic fabric of Sadat’s Egypt at
      a time when whole sections of it had been turned over to unregulated
      capitalism. Uthman Ahmad Uthman, the Egyptian Rockefeller, made no secret
      of this sympathy for the Brethren”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="" class="reference-body-link"
          >2</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Despite this important insight, it is arguable that the role of this
    bourgeois layer is underexplored in the rest of the piece. This is
    significant because two decades on, the relative influence of these
    bourgeois forces on mass Islamist parties across the region has undoubtedly
    grown. No longer are parties like the Muslim Brotherhood, the AKP and
    Hezbollah outsiders to the political establishment, except perhaps in Egypt
    where the repression under Sisi has been immense. It can no longer be said
    that they are primarily parties of the middle class, and certainly they are
    not “reformists”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >3</a
      ></span
    >
    They are now, notwithstanding regional and national differences, integrated
    parts of the capitalist system both politically and economically. This
    transition has manifested in a growing pragmatism and authoritarianism on
    the political front, and an adaptation to neoliberal economics on the
    economic one. To the extent that they still clash with rival sections of
    capital, it is limited to conflict over access to decision-making and
    fund-allocation apparatuses; there are no fundamental disagreements about
    neoliberal economics and developmental strategies as such.
  </p>
  <p>
    Daher ably documents Hezbollah’s journey down this path. To begin with
    Hezbollah strongly opposed the sectarian political structures of Lebanese
    society, and called for the modernisation and democratisation of the
    confessional electoral system. This was partly a reflection of the attitudes
    of the poor and middle-class sections of the Shi’ite community, oppressed
    and excluded as they were by the Lebanese establishment. As well, the
    position was informed by its rivalry with the Lebanese Communist Party and
    the progressive left, who had long enjoyed strong support from the working
    class and poor among the Shi’ite community. Today, Hezbollah has totally
    abandoned these perspectives in return for a stake in the corrupt sectarian
    system of Lebanese politics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although it continues to draw its support from all classes of the Shi’ite
    community, it is Shi’ite elites who increasingly make up the bulk of
    Hezbollah’s leading cadres. This new generation tends to have higher levels
    of tertiary education and wealth than earlier generations of leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
    This tendency reflects the changing nature of Shi’ite communities in
    Lebanon, which is increasingly represented in the professional middle
    classes. Daher documents how in the past decade Hezbollah-affiliated
    candidates have taken over the engineers’ and architects’ association,
    captured the vice-presidency of the dentists’ association, are represented
    in the ruling group in the doctors’ association, and narrowly missed out on
    capturing the pharmacists’ association by less than 0.2 percent of the
    vote.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >4</a
      ></span
    >
    This process is reflected in the social composition of the parliamentary
    wing of the party:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Five of the ten elected Hezbollah deputies hold doctoral degrees, and at
      least four others were involved in prominent Lebanese businesses. The
      longest serving Hezbollah deputy, Ali Ammar, comes from one of the
      wealthiest families in Burj el-Barajneh.<span class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="" class="reference-body-link"
          >5</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>State within a state</h2>
  <p>
    Despite this fundamentally bourgeois nature of the party, Hezbollah leaders
    are extremely concerned with maintaining and expanding their mass base in
    the Shi’ite community. To this end the party has constructed a series of
    civil society organisations that propagate the organisation’s specific brand
    of political, economic and religious ideology.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some ways the party looks similar to the German Social Democratic Party
    (SPD) of the early twentieth century, though far more geared toward
    profit-making. It runs a highly integrated series of institutions, including
    schools, TV, radio and print media, health clinics, tourism and
    entertainment industries, mosques, scout programs, and more. It offers
    discount shopping cards to be used at approved (Hezbollah-supporting,
    Shi’ite-owned) stores, subsidised healthcare for its members, welfare for
    families of those killed in Hezbollah military operations, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Embedded in the structure and discourse of all of these institutions is a
    brand of Shi’ite Islamism first popularised by Ayatollah Khomeini in the
    Iranian revolution. It emphasises the need for complete obedience to supreme
    religious bodies, adherence to strict codes of modesty and propriety, and
    resistance to the US, Israel and its allies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Daher explains how the party has implemented a long term strategy seeking to
    deliberately heighten the religiosity of the Shi’ite community of Lebanon,
    which it sees as a means of cementing its control. This has gone along with
    extremely regressive attitudes towards women and LGBTI people – in areas
    controlled by the party the <em>hijab</em> is more or less imposed on women
    and bans on alcohol and other “sinful” acts are strictly enforced. This
    party has also adopted a more sectarian stance towards other confessional
    groups, and now share with the US establishment an almost obsessive focus on
    the threat of <em>takfiris</em>, or extreme Sunni Islamist groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the most damning aspects of Hezbollah’s political practice – and one
    of the most fascinating aspects of Daher’s book – was its intervention into
    the union movement. In the 1990s it was part of the neoliberal regime of
    Rafiq al-Hariri, and supported the savage privatisation of Lebanon’s assets.
    While Hezbollah began its existence supposedly championing the interests of
    the poor and workers, by this time it was far more oriented to the rights of
    investors and business people.
  </p>
  <p>
    When faced with strong union resistance the government intervened directly
    into the affairs of the General Confederation of Lebanese Workers (CGTL) in
    order to defeat the left and impose passivity. This was done by taking
    advantage of the undemocratic constitutional specificities of the
    federation, which gave equal rights to all unions regardless of size.
    Hezbollah, along with other parties of government, set up a number of fake
    sectarian unions in order to stack out the council and preserve their
    control over key industries. The left was unable to resist this coordinated
    onslaught, and the union movement has been in something of a crisis ever
    since.
  </p>
  <h2>Revolution and counter-revolution</h2>
  <p>
    As is often the case in politics, the cumulative impact of Hezbollah’s
    gradual accommodation to the sectarian status quo could only become fully
    clear under the pressure of decisive events. Daher thus concludes his book
    with an analysis of Hezbollah’s response to the most significant event in
    the Middle East for decades – the revolutions of 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like many guerrilla-type organisations in the region, Hezbollah has
    generally tried to maintain a position of neutrality <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
    internal politics of the various Arab regimes. This mistaken position rests
    on the need for such groups to receive outside funding and weaponry from
    sympathetic state actors, as the guerrilla strategy relies on military
    prowess rather than political or economic mass struggle. So as recently as
    2009 its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, declared that Hezbollah does “not have a
    conflict or a problem with anyone, the Arab political system in this or that
    country, whether democratic, dictatorial, royal or dynastic, religious or
    secular, legal or illegal…regardless of the description we do not interfere
    in such matters”.<span class="floating-ref-link"

  </p>
  <p>
    Yet when the protests began in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Bahrain, the
    party took a principled position in support of the movements, arguing that:
    “[t]he uprisings of the Arab population are a real opportunity to regain
    freedom of decision and to return to the spirit of the Arab position that
    rejects foreign hegemony”.<span class="floating-ref-link"
      ><a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="" class="reference-body-link"
        >7</a
      ></span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Interestingly, Nasrallah began by strongly condemning the conspiracy
    theories which abounded even in the early days:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Any accusation that claims that America is behind these revolutions, has
      incited and stirred them, and is leading them represents a false, unjust
      accusation of these peoples… These are regimes that follow America and
      harmonize with it that have offered and still offer services for the
      American plot, and that do not constitute any threat to the American
      policy – which is “Israel” in the Middle East.<span
        class="floating-ref-link"
        ><a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="" class="reference-body-link"
          >8</a
        ></span
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Yet as the revolution spread throughout Syria, Hezbollah became increasingly
    ambivalent about the revolutions. Daher draws out how their criteria for
    supporting the protest movements – regime attitude to Israel and readiness
    to reform – were applied selectively and hypocritically. In reality, the
    party was totally hostile to the revolution in Syria because Assad was a
    close ally of the Iranian regime, and an important source of resources and
    political backing.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the Syrian government unleashed savage repression on the revolutionaries,
    Hezbollah happily joined in, participating in sieges, raids, bombings and
    mass killings of civilian targets across the country. It has also helped to
    train foreign Shi’ite militias organised by Iran, which have played a
    crucial role in recapturing territory from the rebels in the absence of
    Assad’s largely defunct Syrian Arab Army.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hezbollah has paid a huge price for this intervention, losing over 1,300
    soldiers to death or serious injury. Much more significant in the long run
    is its loss of prestige in the Arab world. Emerging from 2006 as the first
    force to have defeated Israel in decades, Nasrallah was the most loved Arab
    leader across the region, among both Sunnis and Shi’ites.<span
      class="floating-ref-link"

    Its fighters and supporters received shelter from all Lebanese communities
    during the war, and were seen as being on the front line of pan-Arab
    resistance to Israel. This reputation is in tatters as a result of their
    highly sectarian, counter-revolutionary intervention into Syria, and it is
    difficult to see how it can be rebuilt.

  <p>
    Tellingly, Hezbollah now opposes any talk of regime change in the Arab
    world, except in Bahrain where the (consciously non-sectarian) movement
    consisted largely of Shi’ites due to the demographics of the country, and
    was directed against a pro-Saudi, largely Sunni ruling class.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Taken together, the argument made by Daher clearly indicates that Hezbollah
    is a bourgeois party on the counter-revolutionary wing of Arab politics,
    where it joins many other Islamist organisations that have found a home in
    the corrupt world of Arab capitalism. The driving force of this evolution
    has not been religion <em>per se</em>, but the overall hegemonic project of
    a section of Shi’ite capital, in which religion functions as a unifying and
    disciplining social and political framework. Being part of an anti-American
    geopolitical bloc does not mean the group is progressive, as reflected in
    the organisation’s reactionary economic and social policies. While this
    analysis of Hezbollah does not rule out collaboration and joint activities
    in certain fields – for instance in opposition to another Israeli invasion –
    it suggests a qualitatively different orientation to that of the Lebanese
    Communist Party and their fellow travellers in the country. It also means we
    need a fundamentally different approach from that of former left wing MP
    George Galloway and other Stalinist-influenced Western leftists who see
    Hezbollah as a core prop of the axis of resistance in the Middle East. The
    failure of this analysis is reflected in Hezbollah’s increasing disavowal of
    “oppositional” rhetoric, and its recurring tendency to block with the
    establishment – including its supposed rivals in the March 14 alliance –
    whenever challenged.
  </p>
  <p>
    The book is a must-read for those seeking to understand Middle Eastern
    politics. It provides much needed detail and historical context for
    understanding the rise of one of the most important political parties in the
    region, and begins the process of deepening and updating Chris Harman’s
    earlier work to provide a Marxist framework for understanding Islamism more
    generally. For as Daher says in his conclusion, it would be wrong to see the
    Islamism of Hezbollah and other such parties as a mere rhetorical device.
    Rather, it is a core aspect of the party’s political program and
    institutional structures, which are both shaped by and in turn shape the
    structures of capitalism in the Middle East. It will take both an increase
    in class struggle and the development of consciously non-sectarian working
    class political organisations to break down the social and political reality
    of sectarianism in the region. In the meantime, serious effort needs to be
    put into analysing the proliferation of mass Islamist organisations and
    working out how to build an independent left wing pole of organisation, to
    try to understand and undercut the disastrous polarisation of Middle Eastern
    politics into “secular” and Islamist brands of neoliberal authoritarianism.
    Daher’s book is a great intellectual contribution to this broader political
    challenge.

          See Bouharoun 2017 and Naguib 2007 for examples of references to the
          “reformist” Muslim Brotherhood. This can be traced partially to Chris
          Harman’s reference to the Brothers as having “adopted a ‘reformist
          Islamist’ orientation” in <em>The prophet and the proletariat</em>.
          While the latter formulation is useful in distinguishing the Brothers
          and similar organisations from the more extremist terrorist groups,
          the slide to describing them as “reformists” is profoundly mistaken
          and flies in the face of traditional Marxist understanding of
          reformist consciousness and organisations.
