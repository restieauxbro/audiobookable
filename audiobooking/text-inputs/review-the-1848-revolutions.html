      Christopher Clark,
      <em>Revolutionary Spring: Fighting for a New World 1848–1849</em>, Allen
      Lane, 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Revolutionary Spring</em> challenges the persistent and powerful
      historical view of the revolutions of 1848–49 as failures. Yes, they began
      tumultuously, dramatically, full of enthusiasm and dreams of new and
      better worlds; yes, they were relatively quickly undone, variously
      destroyed by internal divisions, and by increasingly violent and
      sophisticated policing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the notion of “failure” persists, argues Clark, because in retrospect
      these revolutions have been appropriated into national narratives. This
      enables singular treatments, depriving them of the historically
      transformative and Europe-wide upheavals they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clark begins by creating a detailed and layered backdrop of “economic
      precarity”, filth, disease, unrestrained labour exploitation, huge wealth,
      mass poverty, inequalities, social tensions and conflicts, rural and urban
      divides, a Europe alive with critics and dissidents “not locked into
      finished worldviews”, a Europe where social orders were straining and
      waiting to break.

    <p>
      Against this he explores the revolutions with respect to their local
      roots, individualities and non-linear courses. Individual as they were,
      they took place simultaneously across a vast continental geography. Clark
      explores this and the ways they were linked. It is a huge task, and
      Clark’s book is not a hurriedly cobbled together work. The result of years
      of research and writing, its origins are in his earlier studies of
      European history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characterising the revolutions as the mid-nineteenth century’s “particle
      collision chamber”, Clark argues they became an “unfinished revolution”, a
      watershed from which Europe did not recover. This latter term should be
      read poetically in a political way, the sense being that the revolutions
      opened up the future. Not only to nationalism, the general
      historiographical preference, but robustly to liberative possibilities:
      ideas and notions about liberalism, radicalism, democracy, republicanism,
      socialism, social rights; the emancipations of women, slaves, Jews; the
      nature of government; the tactics of resistance and revolt; how to bring
      about social change. And some of these will always be works in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revolutions ended with counter-revolutionary policing, the
      counter-revolutionary forces able to build alliances which the
      revolutionaries failed to do. Vicious “cleansing” reprisals followed.
      Traditionally, Britain is portrayed as having escaped the turmoil of the
      period, the main dissident contender being Chartism. The line is that
      Chartism was too fractured with internal divisions to hold together, that
      the savvy British ruling class let air out of the balloon with gradual
      reform concessions, that the Chartists were good-natured folk after all.
      Well no, says Clark. Robust and mass policing involving regular police,
      huge troop deployments, and specially recruited constables with licence to
      use violence smashed the movement. Ireland was contained similarly. As
      Clark shows, the British model of policing became one informing
      continental counter-revolutionaries. Besides, Clark observes, Britain also
      had the offshore safety valve of its Empire and deportation to help thwart
      dissidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Clark winds up his narrative, traces of those revolutionaries who
      survived the reprisals leave tracks. Some variously went quiet, changed
      politics, pulled their heads in and worked through the system, went
      underground, while a diaspora of radicals with ideas in their heads and
      luggage, spread globally and helped make histories elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running to 873 pages, <em>Revolutionary Spring </em>is a weighty tome. The
      canvas is vast. Clark is imaginatively at home in the Europe of the time,
      a rich tapestry of empires, kingdoms, states, principalities, ethnicities,
      demographies, all geopolitically unique with their own cultures,
      traditions and histories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maps at the front of the book assist the reader navigate this Europe
      before empires were variously dismantled and geographies reshaped by
      nationalism. Clark shows how the revolutionary zeal and political energies
      of the period went beyond continental Europe, ripples and convolutions
      variously experienced in Britain, the French Caribbean, Latin America, the
      United States, even colonial Australia. Readers may be surprised to find
      the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria part of Clark’s canvas.
      Discussing the impact of the 1848–49 Revolutions, he deftly includes the
      Eureka Stockade and Australian constitutional reform as parts of the
      fallout.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Clark is a European historian, with one of the history world’s top
      gigs as Regius Professor of History at Cambridge University, he is also an
      Australian. Schooled in Australia, he took his first degree at Sydney
      University in the 1980s. The Free University of Berlin and Cambridge
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In part at least, it seems to me, in the art of the book’s creation and
      writing there is the spirit of EP Thompson, in the way Clark handles the
      galaxy of players with agency across class divides, many unfamiliar and
      needing concise biographical detail to make them part of the account; and
      in his understandings of dissident culture in poetry, song, broadsheets,
      pamphlets, newspapers, meetings, conversations, in formal and in informal
      sites like pubs, cafés, streets. Clark is on record elsewhere respectfully
      referring to Thompson as a “great British historian”.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Revolutionary Spring </em>ends with 113 pages of References and Index.
      The References reveal the huge and diverse amount of material Clark has
      drawn on, multilingual material that crosses all manner of divides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before these there are three pages of Acknowledgements. Clark has drawn on
      many fellow scholars and friends for expertise, advice and comment. Some
      have granted access to works in progress, and works in pre-publication
      stages. This points to collegial trust and sharing often absent in modern
      academia. Clark notes that conversations are indispensable in knowledge
      production, and he acknowledges these individually. It is a pleasure to
      see this, since this tends not to be valued by the modern systems and
      metrics that manage scholarship.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Revolutionary Spring</em> is an impressive work. Reader-friendly,
      scholarly, it is an invitation to, and demonstration of, a long view of
      history. It eloquently counters a historical tradition that gives
      <em>failure </em>hegemonic import, and which paves ways for shadows of
      futility and despair to hover over radical dreaming and activism. For
      people on the right side of history, in a time when a great deal of
      energy, power and politics is destructively and mischievously fed into
      generating messages of despair and end times,
      <em>Revolutionary Spring</em> is worth consideration; a book for our
      times.
